Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Answer the phone
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same

Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first

(Hey)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was--------------------

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from Hell"

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees

It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero--------------------

You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad

Onun çifte Grammy'leri, çifte plaketleri, ayy
Bu bir gerçek, ayy, salla kalçayı, ayy
Salla kalçayı, ayy

Ve bu da şampiyonlar için
Başladığımdan beri kaybetmedim, evet
Bunun son olduğunu söylemeniz çok komik, evet
Sonra yine yaptım, evet

Sana uzun zaman önce yolda söylemiştim
Bekledikleri şeyi aldım
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmam, peşini bırakmam
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara gizlenmediğimi söyle
Zaten beni hiç desteklememiştin
Tekrar zirveye çıktığımda, senin şunu dediğini duymak istiyorum
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmıyor, kaçmıyor
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara molanın bittiğini söyle

Ah, yapmam gerekiyor, ah
Bu albümü bitirmem gerekiyor
Birkaç bir numaraya ihtiyacım var
Her şarkıda bir plakete ihtiyacım var
Şimdi Nicki'yle bir tanesine ihtiyacım var
Bir rap zencisine sizi görmediğimi söyle, hah
Ben Bieber gibi pop zencisiyim, hah
Ben sürtükleri becermem, ben ibneyim, hah
Ama bu zenciler Madea gibi kaltaklar, evet, evet, evet, ayy (Evet)
Oh, hadi yapalım
Düşmedim, sadece yeni şeylerimi piyasaya sunmadım
Ünlü oldum, şimdi herkes beni dava etmeye çalışıyor
Siz bana Nas diyorsunuz, ama mahallem bana Doobie diye sesleniyor, evet

Sicilim o kadar temiz ki, beni ezip geçmek için sabırsızlanıyorlar
Fazla hızlı parlamış olmalıyım, dünyanın beni gazlamasına izin vermemeliydiniz (Woo)
Artık çok geç çünkü burada kalıcıyım ve bu kızlar benim edepsiz olduğumu biliyor (Mmm)
Onu erkek arkadaşına, kıçındaki el izimle geri gönderdim
Tüm şehir konuşuyorken, notlar alıyoruz
Söyle onlara, paylaşıma devam etsinler
Keşke öldürebilse, ama yaklaşamaz bile yanıma
Üstadım o kadar gurur duyuyor ki benle, kadehini kaldırırken boğazı düğümleniyor
Ben senin kontrol edemeyeceğin türden biriyim, yapacağımı söyledim, sonra da yaptım
Söylentileri aydınlatmam (Ayy), espri anlayışınız nerede? (Ayy)
Şaka yapmaktan bıktım çünkü bebek boomer'lar gibi yaşlandılar
Haterlarımı tüketicilere çevirdim, eskilere kendilerini küçük enişte gibi hissettiriyorum (Küçük)
Zamanının yaklaştığını söyle, ama tıpkı Oklahoma gibi (Mmm)
Benim zamanım daha erken geliyor (Mmm), ben sadece geç büyüdüm (Mmm)
Lisede zirve yapmadım, hala buradayım ve daha da şirinleşiyorum (Woo)
Tüm bu sosyal ağlar ve bilgisayarlar
Bu amcıklar ezik değillermiş gibi etrafta dolaşıyor

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

And ain't it funny? All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry

You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you

Don't you dare forget about the way

You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry

You gave me your word, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her

It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around--------------------

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, hey
The smell of your perfume is lingering inside the truck
You're horny, I'm horny, that's what unites us
She knows she's hot and they don't show her off
If I was your man, I'd upload a picture on Fridays and Mondays (So)

For the whole world to see how hot you are, you are
With you, I have to go hard
And I'm loose out on the streets, but I'd quit for you
I'll behave nicely if you ask me to
And I upload a selfie so they can see how hot you are, you are
The other girls have to try harder
And I'm loose out on the streets, but I'd quit for you
I'll behave nicely if you ask me to (Ayy, ayy)

You are not a little baby, you are a grand baby
Freaky, bae, I can see it
She likes threesomes when she's high
If the boyfriend ain't no good then she throws him away
And wow, mami, tell me where should I leave the resume (Resume)
I know you left him a month ago (Ayy, ayy)
And I straight up shot my shot
If you want me to, I'll make you a baby or bring you the plan B
Uff, mami, you look so delicious
In the 2000's, she listened to RBD
And now she wants grinding all night long on the wall
THC, not CBD

Mami, you're elite (Hey), don't limit yourself (Okey)
Let me give you what you deserve and levitate you
Let's go to our hiding spot (Hey), don't you cripple me (So)
The satellites won't be able to reach us here
Mami, upload something, give me some content
Upload that ass more often
I'm just hanging around to see if we can run into each other, hey
And finally find you
Bae, I never forget our horny moments
No one has ever pleased me like you did
You think I always say the same thing to all of them
She wants to fuck, but she doesn't want a relationship, hey
But in confidence she confesses to me
How nobody is of her interest
But when she goes out, she gets naughty (Hey)

For the whole world to see how hot you are, you are, hey
With you, I have to go hard
And I'm loose out on the streets, but I'd quit for you

Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm takin' off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (Take that shit off)
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (Take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mil', hell if I know (Take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (Take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (Take it off)
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, "I'm broke, I care" (Take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (Take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag (Take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin' us
This ain't Monopoly, watchin' for love, this ain't monogamy, y'all gettin' fucked
Jumpin' on what the hell is that? I gotta relax when I feel (Huh, facts)
All my descendants becoming white sheep and say I am too real (Huh, facts)
I'm done with the sensitive, takin' it personal, done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
You hopin' for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries

La vida es lo único que necesitamos
Ellos necesitan que me vaya, pero yo no quiero irme
Descansa en paz Lil Keed

A la mierda un encasillamiento, soy un búho nocturno, este es un modo diferente
Y no es que no sea un buen momento para que te vayas a casa
Escuché que estás con un guardia, sólo deja que un negro lo sepa
Te tendría al lado de la cancha, no en la fila del medio
Todo está bien, amor, en un minuto, sin embargo
No puedo estresarme por ninguna perra porque soy un alma tímida
Además estoy cocinando la ambición en una estufa de cocina
La olla comienza a burbujear, ve la espuma, esa mierda es buena
Las putas dicen que soy suave, pero no puedo conseguir RICO'd
Él cree que es John Wayne, le compré piedras amarillas
Me encanta la forma en que cuelgan, nena, a la mierda la silicona
Todo el mundo es falso ahora, tu podrías descifrar el código
Todo lo que se rompe, se pone en oro rosa
Tengo miedo a hablar con estos negros como si fuera J. Cole
Puedo decir si su cabeza es buena antes de que lo sepa
Perra, no me digas que eres modelo si no has estado en Vogue
Tengo que hacer una fiesta para los que han estado desde el inicio
No están en el estudio, pero van a poner algo
Descansa en paz a Drama King, estábamos en lo más alto
¿No te gusta mi forma de hablar? Negro, di algo
Tengo que hacer una fiesta para los que han estado desde el principio
Muéstrate y sabes que somos nosotros, el bajo está saltando

Ni siquiera lo rodé en el Wood porque está con moho
Si preguntas cómo está, solo le digo que venga y me folle
Le disparó veinte veces, maldita sea, este negro tiene suerte (Diablos, este negro tiene suerte)

Tengo que hacer una fiesta para los que han estado desde el inicio
No están en el estudio, pero van a poner algo
Descansa en paz a Drama King, estábamos en lo más alto
¿No te gusta mi forma de hablar? Negro, di algo

Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

Always had to put yourself above me

Tell me lies, we can argue, we can fight
Yeah, we did it before, but we'll do it tonight
That afro, black boy with the gold teeth
He dark skin, lookin' at me like he know me
I wonder if he got the G or the B
Let me find out and see, he comin' over to me, yeah

These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

I want someonе to love me
I need someonе who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me and my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

Look, you know it's harder to find in these times
But I got nothin' but love on my mind (My mind)
I need a baby while I'm in my prime
Need an adversary to my "down and weary"
Like, tell me "That's life" when I'm stressin' at night
Be like, "You'll be okay" and, "Everything is alright," uh
Let me in that thing, 'cause I'm not wanting anything
But you're loving your body and a little bit of your brain

These days, I'm way too lonely
I'm missing out, I know
These days, I'm way too alone
And I'm known for givin' love away, but

I want someone to love me
I need someone who needs me
'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me and my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want

I want someone to love me
I need someone who needs me

'Cause it don't feel right when it's late at night
And it's just me and my dreams
So I want someone to love
That's what I fuckin' want--------------------

I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out, no need to take it slow
I'm stepping to you toe-to-toe
I should be scared, honey, maybe so

But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below

I ain't worried 'bout it
I ain't worried 'bout it (Hey)

I don't know what you've been told
But time is running out so spend it like it's gold
I'm living like I'm nine-zeros
Got no regrets even when I am broke (Yeah)
I'm at my best when I got something I'm wanting to steal
Way too busy for them problems and problems to feel (Yeah, yeah)
No stressing, just obsessing with sealing the deal
I'll take it in and let it go

But I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Keeping dreams alive, 1999, heroes
I ain't worried 'bout it right now (Right now)
Swimmin' in the floods, dancing on the clouds below

Kali Uchis
Her yerde dolarlar var
Dolarlar, dolarlar, evet
Dolarlar, dolarlar
Evet, bana bakıp duruyorsun (Neden bana bakıyorsun?)
Ne kadar süredir bilmiyorum

Önümde hiçbir engel yokmuş gibi hissediyorum
Üstümdeki tüm bu paralar bana şahane hissetiriyor
Range Rover'dayım, yarışıyorum
Ben ve sevgilin hala birlikteyiz
Konuşmak istemiyorum, dans, dans ediyorum
Sahte aşklara falan ihtiyacım yok
Hayır, yardıma falan da ihtiyacım yok
Zamanımın geleceğini biliyorum
Sadece ben ve yaratıcım
Para kazanacağım
Para kazanacağım
Dolarlar kazanacağım
Paramı alacağım, evet

Yolumdan çekilsene
Paramı alacağım, evet
Paramı almak istiyorum, evet
Sadece bana paramı ver
Yolumdan çekilsene
Paramı alacağım, evet
Paramı alacağım, evet
Sadece bana paramı ver

Partiyi çok seviyorum
Partiyi çok seviyorum
Partiyi çok seviyorum, vücudumu kontrol edemiyorum
O yüzden bu şarkı başladığında tüm planlarını iptal et
Dansımdan da aşikar değil mi, Michael Jackson gibi moonwalk yapıyorum

Vücudunu çok beğendim, vücudunu çok beğendim
Neden saklıyorsun ki anlamıyorum, seni arkamda görmek istiyorum
Biliyorsun, bana yalan söylemene gerek yok
Seni içimde hissetmek istiyorum
Tüm gün seni hayal ediyorum, seni bütün gece boyunca istiyorum
Ve yardıma ihtiyacım olmadığını biliyorsun
Sahte aşka ihtiyacım olmadığını da
Devamlı kameralarla çevrili bir sürtüğüm
Sadece birkaç insanın idare edebileceği bir sürtük
Ve çok tehlikeli olduğumu biliyormuş gibi yürüyorum
Sözlerim melek tozundan yapılmış gibi konuşuyorum
Kulağına birkaç dilde şeyler fısıldıyorum
İstediği şey, bebeğim, arkama öpücükler kondurman
Tüm gün boyunca birkaç yüz milyon öpücük yani
Bana zevk veren tek şey bu
Sana yaramaz şeyler yapmak istediğimi biliyorsun
Ve seni okşamalarımla yakmak istediğimi
Dilin vücudumun her yerinde
İşini bitirdiğinde, içimde kal
Dilin vücudumun her yerinde
Ve işini bitirdiğinde, içimde kal

Yolumdan çekilsene
Paramı alacağım, evet
Paramı almak istiyorum, evet
Sadece bana paramı ver
Yolumdan çekilsene
Paramı alacağım, evet
Paramı alacağım, evet
Sadece bana paramı ver

Partiyi çok seviyorum, vücudunu çok seviyorum
Yaramazlaşmak istiyorum, çok ateşli olduğunu düşünüyorum
Partide yavaşça dans ediyoruz
Ah evet, parayı bana getir
Miami'ye uçak bileti al, bebeğim, beni çıkar bu ülkeden
Neden aslan burcuymuş gibi davranmaya çalışıyorsun?
Sanki beni sevmiyormuş gibi, hadi ama
Sanki paranı bana harcamıyormuş gibi, sanki amımı yemiyormuş gibi

Sola doğru, sağa doğru, öne doğru, evet, evet, evet
Doğru olduğunu biliyorum, paralar artıyorsa, evet, evet, evet de--------------------

O-O-Ovy On The Drums
Cheers, mami
Ah, ah, ah, ay

What doesn't help, don't let it get in the way
You made an own goal for being clumsy
The torque turned out to be too big for you
I'm not for you to fall in love with anymore, baby (Chi)
Without a Visa or passport
I sent your fake love on a vacation (Chi, chi, chi, chi, chi, chi)
Fuck off and don't come back
I hope you get everything you deserve, no
For what you did to me if you don't remember

Don't call me again, I threw out the phone
Because of how toxic you are, it became harmful
What goes, goes
Don't misunderstand me
Bеcause of how toxic you are, I don't want to see you again (Chi)

I got to the party, takе the bottle out
The one that loved you, I don't know who she is
I left you a review, I didn't give you even one star
And I forgot you because you didn't leave footprints
I don't look back anymore, not even to park
I have one that's ready to take me
The second is waiting in the hotel
And the third, I'll meet him tonight (No, no)
Don't call me, 'cause I changed my number (Changed)
If you want me to give it you (Give)
Call 1-800-go fuck yourself
I don't know if you heard me
Don't call me, 'cause I changed my number (Changed)
If you want me to give it you (Give)
Call 1-800-go fuck yourself

Don't call me again, I even threw out the phone
Because of how toxic you are, it became harmful
What goes, goes, ah-ah
Don't misunderstand me
Because of how toxic you are, I don't want to see you again (Ayy)

Ay, I'm sorry (Ah)
You're desire to come back (Ayy) died in the attempt (Ah)
You made it look like you lost time
You came out well because I don't even count mine (Papi)
I see you on social media, I can't believe it, what a shame (What a shame)
I was good and you such trash paying me back like that (Wow, such trash)
Rat with two feet, Paquita said it
A creeping animal (Haha)
That eats everything he finds
Damn, you're a whore (Whore)
Don't say "I adore you", instead be honest (Ayy)
Don't say "I love you" (Ah) because that was in vain (Ah)
You were crying and since I didn't get with you
You're eating another, but you're thinking of me (Chi)

Don't call me again, I even threw out the phone
Because of how toxic you are, it became harmful
What goes, goes, ah-ah
Don't misunderstand me
Because of how toxic you are, I don't want to see you again

Ouh
Repeat it, mami
"Sometimes they don't change you for something better
And not even for something more tasty"

That girl’s alright with me, yeah
Ayo (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

I can lick it, I can ride it while you slippin' and slidin'

You can smack it, you can grip it, you can go down and kiss it
And every time he leave me ’lone, he always tell me he miss it

He want a F-R-E-A-K (Freaky girl)

He know the prettiest bitch didn't come until I arrive
I don't let bitches get to me, I fuck they man if they try
I got a princess face, a killer body, samurai mind
They can't be Nicki, they so stupid, I just laugh when they try
A thong bikini up my ass, I think I'll go for a dive
His ex-bitch went up against me, but she didn't survive
On applications I write "pressure" 'cause that’s what I apply (Brr)
P-P-P-Pressure applied, can’t fuck a regular guy
Wetter than umbrellas and stickier than apple pie

I can lick it, I can ride it while you slippin' and slidin’

He said "Could you throw it back while you touch the ground?"
Then he said "Do that pussy purr?" I said "Yup, meow"
Hold up, fuck-boys, ain't need no for you to roll up
Ain't no need for you to double tap neither, scroll up
Keep these bitches on they toes like Manolo
Be on the lookout when I come through, BOLO
Oh, woah, elegant bitch with a ho glow
If it ain't big, then I won't blow
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Fuck is the tea? I just F'd a G (Let's go)
Made him say "Uh," just ask Master P (Let's go)
Ball so hard, I just took a knee (Let's go)
Get me rocky ASAP, nigga, word to Rih (Let's go)

Yeah, yeah

The last few months, I've been workin' on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize

And I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind

Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)

If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Give me one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I shoulda loved you all the time

And I remember when I held you (Held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay (Never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you (Hey)
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind (Uh)

Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time (No)
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time (Hey)
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)

Ooh, singin', out of time
Said I had you to myself, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Uh)
Out of time (Pretend—)
Out of time (Pretend—)

Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever
Here's thirty minutes of easy listening to some slow tracks

Lyrics for 'SNAP' by Rosa Linn:
43 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolDeutschPortuguêsTürkçeFrançaisSNAP Lyrics
It's 4 AM
I can't turn my head off
Wishing these memories would fade, they never do
Turns out people lie
They said, "Just snap your fingers"
As if it was really that easy for me to get over you

I just need time

Snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap

I'm writin' a song
Said, "This is the last one"
How many last songs are left? I'm losing count
Since June 22nd
My heart's been on fire
I've been spendin' my nights in the rain tryin' to put it out

So I'm snappin' one, two
Where are you?
You're still in my heart
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore
Get out of my heart
'Cause I might snap

Oh-woah
'Cause I might snap
Oh-woah

And if one more person says, "You should get over it"
Oh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap, snap, snap
Oh, I might stop talkin' to people before I snap

Snappin' one, two
Where are you? (Where are you?)
You're still in my heart (Still in my heart)
Snappin' three, four
Don't need you here anymore (Need you here anymore)
Get out of my heart

'Cause I might sna—, I might snap (Oh-woah)
'Cause I might sna—, I might snap (Oh-woah)
Get out of my heart, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, heart (Oh-woah)
'Cause I might snap (Oh-woah)
Get out of my heart, yeah

4 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishEspañolPortuguêsFrançaisItalianoCamila Cabello - Bam Bam ft. Ed Sheeran (Deutsche Übersetzung) Lyrics

Du sagtest, du hasst den Ozean, aber jetzt surfst du
Ich sagte, ich würde dich ein Leben lang lieben, aber ich habe gerade unser Haus verkauft
Anfangs waren wir Kinder, ich schätze, jetzt sind wir Erwachsene, mm
Konnte mir nie vorstellen, Zweifel zu haben
Aber nicht alles klappt, nein

Jetzt gehe ich aus und tanze mit Fremden
Du könntest unverbindliche Dates haben
Verdammt, es ändert sich alles so schnell

So ist das Leben, ja
Ja, so ist das Leben nun mal, Baby
Ja, die Liebe kam und hat mich umgehauen
Aber ich bin wieder auf meinen Füßen
So ist das Leben, ja, ja, so ist nun mal das Leben, Baby
Ich konnte kaum noch stehen, aber jetzt tanze ich
Er bekommt nicht genug von mir

Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam (So ist das Leben, ja)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Aha)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Eh, eh, aha)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam (Aha)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam

Es war ein krasses Jahr, Gott sei Dank haben wir es überstanden
Ja, wir ritten eine Welle und versuchten nicht zu ertrinken
Und oberflächlich riss ich mich zusammen
Aber darunter bin ich ein bisschen auseinandergefallen
Wo würde ich sein? Du bist alles, was ich brauche
Meine Welt, Baby, du hältst mich am Boden
Du hältst mich immer am Boden

Nun, ich war ein Zerstörer und zerstört
Jeder Felehr wird zu Momenten
Würde nichts zurücknehmen

So ist das Leben, ja (So ist)
Ja, so ist das Leben, Baby
Ja, die Liebe kam zurück und sie warf mich um
Aber ich bin zurück auf meinen Beinen
So ist das Leben, Baby
Ja, so ist das Leben, Baby
Ich konnte kaum noch stehen, aber jetzt tanze ich
Sie bekommt nicht genug von mir (Sie bekommt nicht genug von mir)

Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam

Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam (Streue Zucker darauf, meine Leute!)

Und tanze weiter, hey
Und tanze weiter, a-ha
(Tanze weiter, ja)
Und tanze weiter
(Tanze weiter, ja!)
Und tanze weiter (Hey!), a-ha (Die Liebe ist überall)
Und tanze weiter
(Tanze weiter, ja) (Weiter, weiter, tanze weiter)
Und tanze weiter (Hey!) (Die Liebe ist überall)
Und tanze weiter, woah (Weiter, weiter, tanze weiter)

So ist das Leben, ja
Ja, so ist das Leben nun mal, Baby
Ja, die Liebe kam zurück und sie warf mich um
Aber ich bin zurück auf meinen Beinen
So ist das Leben, ja
Ja, das ist das Leben, Baby
Ich konnte kaum noch stehen, aber jetzt tanze ich
Sie bekommt nicht genug von mir (Hey! Hey!)

Ich–, ich tanze jetzt (Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)
Tanze weiter, ja
Ich–, ich tanze jetzt (Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)
Tanze weiter, ja
Ich–, ich tanze jetzt (Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam)
Tanze weiter, ja (Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam) (Hey! Hey!)
