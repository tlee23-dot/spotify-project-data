My honeybee, come and get this pollen

I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

(Ooh, ooh)

Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

Right next to you
Next to you

For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God

It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith
If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all

It's fine, it's cool
You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth
And guess I'm the fool
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof

I don't wanna call it off
But you don't wanna call it love
You only wanna be the one that I call "baby"

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, 'nother stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

I'm cliché, who cares?
It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
And I cry, it's not fair
I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air

Think I'm gonna call it off
Even if you call it love
I just wanna love someone who calls me "baby"

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling

Ah, ah-yeah, oh
When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife
And when you think about me all of those years ago
You're standing face to face with "I told you so"
You know I hate to say, I told you so
You know I hate to say, but I told you so

You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (Well, I told you so)

All I'm asking, baby

In case you haven't noticed
Well, everybody's tired
And healin' from somebody
Or somethin' we don't see just right

Boy, come on, put your lipstick on (No one can tell you nothin')
Come on and walk this way through the fire (Don't care what's on their mind)
And if you find yourself in a dark situation
Just turn on your light and be like

Oh, I leave quite an impression
Five feet to be exact
You're wonderin' why half his clothes went missin'
My body's where they're at

Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation

I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do
Just know you'll taste me too

Uh-huh

He pins you down on the carpet
Makes paintings with his tongue (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Hе's funny now, all his jokes hit different
Guеss who he learned that from?

Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation

I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do (I bet you do)
Just know you'll taste me too

La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Every time you close your eyes
And feel his lips, you're feelin' mine
And every time you breathe his air
Just know I was already there
You can have him if you like
I've been there, done that once or twice
And singin' 'bout it don't mean I care
Yeah, I know I've been known to share

Well, I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do (I bet you do)
Just know you'll taste me too

Taste me too, ow (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
You, no, yeah, ah-ah (La-la-la-la-la-la-la)
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you--------------------

Post Malone) (Bản dịch tiếng Việt) Lyrics

Em đáng ra phải bị bắt đi rồi
Nhưng người ta đã quên đến đón em
Em là một con sâu rượu đang sống ổn thoả
Cho đến khi chẳng còn ai để ý đến gu thẩm mỹ mới của em nữa
Tất cả để nói rằng
Em mong anh vẫn ổn
Nhưng anh chính là lý do
Và chẳng ai trách gì đâu
Nhưng còn sự phản bội lặng thầm của anh thì sao?

Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, mình bên nhau muôn đời
Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, hỏi vu vơ thời tiết
Giờ anh sau sân vườn, hóa thành hàng xóm tốt
Vợ anh đang tưới hoa, em muốn giết chết ả

Những sớm mai của em là những thứ Hai mắc kẹt trong một tháng 2 bất tận
Em đã uống thứ thuốc bước tiếp diệu kỳ, nhưng tác dụng chỉ là tạm thời thôi
Và em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em
Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em
Em chạm vào anh trong vỏn vẹn 2 tuần
Em chạm vào anh, nhưng em đã bên anh

Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, mình đã cùng bên nhau
Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, hỏi vu vơ thời tiết
Giờ anh sau sân vườn, hóa thành hàng xóm tốt
Vợ anh đang tưới hoa, em muốn giết chết ả
Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, mình đã cùng bên nhau
Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, khen chiếc áo em mang
Giờ anh ở hòm thư, hóa thành hàng xóm tốt
Chồng em đang ngoại tình, em muốn giết chết ảnh

Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em
Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em
Em chạm tới anh trong vỏn vẹn 2 tuần
Em chạm vào anh, em chạm vào anh
Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em
Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em
Em chạm tới anh trong vỏn vẹn 2 tuần
Em chạm vào anh, em chạm vào anh

Nghĩ đến chuyện gọi em, nhưng em chẳng bắt máy
Thêm 2 tuần nữa lạc giữa xứ cờ hoa
Chuyển đến Florida, mua chiếc xe em thích
Nhưng nó chẳng nổ máy tới khi em chạm, chạm, chạm vào anh
Nghĩ đến chuyện gọi em, nhưng em chẳng bắt máy
Thêm 2 tuần nữa lạc giữa xứ cờ hoa
Chuyển đến Florida, mua chiếc xe em thích

Dışarı çık, gece için (Evet)

Kafam hep güzel (Sürtük!)

Kariyerin sen zirvedеyken daha da tehlike altında
Evrakları boş vеr, yüzüm imza yerine geçer
Biraz nefes almak için şehirden ayrılıyorum
Sanki her zaman benden bi' parça istiyorlarmış gibi
Hep geleceğe odaklıydım, hiçbir zaman şimdiye değil
İçtiğim kombucha değil, ya pembe ya da kahverengi
Şu anda sana seni tanıtan benim
Aman Tanrım! Bu kaltak ısırıyor
Pekala, keyfime bakmaya çalışacağım
Gece olunca, gitgide canlanıyor
Uyku yok, yok, yok, yok

Kafayı sıyırıp bunları canlı yayında izletiyordum, dur hele
Yanlış hareket ettin ve biz de lastiklerini patlattık, dur hele
Yüz tane kurşun, öfkeli hissediyorum
Bu kaltaklarla ikili oynuyorum, kızım, arkadaşını sikiyorum
Delirdiğim de oldu, kızım, diplerde de olmuştum
O kız masum falan değil, şey gibi davranmaya çalışıyor-

Sürtüklerime elmaslar alıyorum, sürtüklerimi güzel giydiriyorum
Bu bambaşka bir seviye kızım, sürtükleri parmak uçlarında dolaştırırım
Bu kaşara yol verdim çünkü Opium ortamımıza takılmaya çalıştı
Bu sürtükse benle, bana bir şeyler göstermeye çalışıyor
Günlerce yetecek kadar flowum var, bu zenciler hiçbir şeyden anlamıyor
Kardeşimle stüdyoya kapandık, bu işten anladığımızı biliyorsun
Bizim köşede güneş doğana kadar deliler gibi takılıyoruz
Hala o kaltak için endişeleniyorsun, o kaltak seçimini yaptı bile
Bütün silahlar mutfakta, konumumu falan atamam
Zebani, zebani, zebani
Neden bu zenciler bizi tanıyormuş gibi davranıyorlar?
Opium ve Cactus, işi iyice büyüttük
Orospumu değiştirdim, bu zenciler buradan atılıyor

Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me (Mm-hmm)
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah

Lyrics for 'Stick Season' by Noah Kahan:
69 ContributorsTranslationsالعربيةEspañolDeutschFrançaisNorskItalianoStick Season Lyrics
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me "forever," now you still can't call me back

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

Oh, that'll have to do
My other half was you
I hope this pain's just passin' through
But I doubt it

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

Você tem muita coragem, não tem, querida?
Eu só encho a cara porque você me faz fazer isso
Você 'tá dizendo pra todos os seus amigos que eu sou louco
Como se eu fosse o único
Por que você os apedrejaria se você
Tinha um ou dois grandes desejos?
Morando nessa grande casa de vidro com uma bela visão
Eu achei que você sabia que

Eu tive ajuda
Não é como se eu pudesse fazer toda essa bagunça por conta própria
Não aja como se você não tivesse me ajudado a puxar a garrafa pra fora da prateleira
Estive bem envolvido em todo final de semana, se não percebeu
Eles dizem, "Trabalho em equipe faz o sonho acontecer"
É lógico que eu tive ajuda (Ajuda)

Você achou que eu levaria a culpa por termos terminado
Ande por aí como se você não fosse a culpada de algo
Já perdeste o jogo que esteve fugindo
Parece que está te alcançando, né
Você acha que é tão inocente
Depois de toda a merda que fez
Eu não sou um anjo, você não é enviada dos céus
Não consigo nos tirarmos disso

To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then

Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire, lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great
But while in this world

I think I'll take my whiskey neat

But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along
Babe, don't get me wrong

You know you're bright as the morning, as soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait
Until that day
I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me

Moaning in my ear (Ha)
And I keep making her fall in love, giving her presents, buying stuff all day long
Whatever you want, baby girl
Now we're drifting apart, I'm not seeing you, the days go by
Being alone is what you prefer
Come and give me a chance to grind on you
To get you all wet down there
Another night giving you, giving you
Touching you, heating you up

Baby, go on, get ready for me, follow me
You are like for me, I'm your Brad Pitt
Girl, you're only, send me your location
Move it, dance to the rhythm of the TikTok
That girl ran away with me
The one who fucks her is me
I stole her when we were young

Ayy

(I want to fuck you, I'm gonna take you away)

('Cause if you're with me, nothing will happen to you)
You and me in La Serena
On the Avenida del Mar

(Tell me if it happens)

Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh

You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about (Yeah)

Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
(Work it out)

Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about

I wanna try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Kiss it, ride it, can I fit it?
Charli likes boys, but she knows I'd hit it

Charli, call me if you're with it

I could go and read your mind
Think about your dumb face all the time
Living in your glass house, I'm outside, uh
Looking into big blue eyes
Did it just to hurt me, make me cry
Smiling through it all, yeah, that's my life

You're an idiot, now I'm sure
Now I'm positive, I should go and warn her

Ooh, bet you're thinking, "She's so cool"
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh

What'd she do to get you off? (Uh-huh)
Taking down her hair like, oh my God
Taking off your shirt, I did that once
Or twice, uh
No, I know, I know I'll fuck off (Uh-huh)
But I think I like her, she's so fun
Wait, I think I hate her, I'm not that evolved

I'm sorry she's missing it, sad, sad boy
Not my business, but I had to warn ya

Ooh, bet you're thinking, "She's so cool"
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
Ooh, you've got me thinking, "She's so cool"
But I know what I know and you're just another dude
Ooh, that's so true, ooh

Made it out alive, but I think I lost it
Said that I was fine, said it from my coffin
Remember how I died when you started walking?
That's my life, that's my life
I'll put up a fight, taking out my earrings
Don't you know the vibe? Don't you know the feeling?
You should spend the night, catch me on your ceiling
That's your prize, that's your prize
Well

Mm, bet you're thinking, "She's so cool"
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh

I can read your mind
"She's having the time of her life"
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies
(One, two, three, four)

'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
Even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting, "More"
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart

I can hold my breath
I've been doin' it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test
(One, two, three, four)

'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
In stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, "More"

Güneş parlıyor, sona erdi
Yarın oldu
Kendini ışıkta, aşkında yıka
XO
Ooh, evet, ooh, evet, hayır

Küçüklüğümden beri, olayın ben olduğunu biliyordum (Ooh, evet)
Hatun sürekli gelmek istiyor, çakılmak istiyor (Çok sert çakılmak istiyor)
Yanımda tuttuğum için ilkim olduğunu zannediyor
Çift O, saati kapla, benim zamansız olduğumu biliyor (Zamansız)
Oğluma bir kaç parça Rick geçiriyorum
Silahı kalçadan çekiyorum
Cepler yirmi ikilik klipleri tutuyor (Ah)
Kalbini kırıyorum, Comme Garçons
Üstüne bir şey giy, zeplin üstüne basıl
Leke gibi bir sürtük, yalamaya hazır ol
Küçüklüğümden beri, olayın ben olduğunu bildiğimi anlatmak zorundaydım (Oh)
Şarkılarımı söylüyor, kendinden geçmek istiyor, bir fırt çekmeye çalışıyor
Banka gibi ev, bu orospuyu yatır, şu çeki yatır
Yüzümde gülümseme, rol yapmıyorum, gel ve kontrol edil (Ah)
Boynumda buz, çift O bilekler
Kız Scat'de, ne tekerler ama
Siperlerden yeni çıktı, dört yüz paket
Ah, evet, Paris’te dönüp dolaşıyorum (Ah)
Orospular için giyin, üstüne akın edecekler
Gazoza dört damla koydum, baloncukları çıkıyor
Uyuşturucular iyi vuracak, hasta gibiyim
Bütün şeytanların ile güreşiyorum, The Rock gibi hissediyorum

(Siktir, ah, evet)
Çocukluğumdan beri, hakiki oldum (Çocuk, ooh, yok)
Eğer sen olsaydım, bileklerimi keserdim (Salak oros)
Tüm vücudunu XO dövmesi sarmış, evet (Evet)
Kız sadece takılmak istiyor ve benim için sorun değil, evet
Küçüklüğümden beri, hakiki oldum (Ooh, yok, ah)
Kızı salmalısın, özgür olmak istiyor (Oh, evet)
Vücudunda Çift O dövmesi, evet
Ne söyledikleri önemli değil, ben zamansızım, evet (Shevet)

Oh, eve döndüğümde şehir ateşler içinde
Gökyüzünü doldur (Evet), Dome'u dolduruyorum
Bir gün bunu oynatacaklar (Evet), ne performanstı ama
Ama can yakacak çünkü ilk biz başardık
Skateboard P gibi hissediyorum, BBC tayfa emekliyor
Yıl '03’müş gibi hissediyorum, bağlantılı Neptune davulları (Evet)
Karı mastürbasyoncu hippinin teki, ekiple yatmak istiyor
Kremaya aşık oldu (Evet), sahneye aşık oldu
Ooh, evet, erkeği sessiz, çıt çıkmıyor (Oh, yok)
Kalbini kırdı, TSSB (Oh, yok)
Göğsünü tut, nefes almasına izin ver
Nefes almasına izin ver, zenciler planlar kuruyorlar
Ve bir rahibim var, haçı tutuyor
Yoldan çık, Allah'ına gönder
Bir damla gözyaşı döktüm, kayıp için dua ettim, ooh, evet (Evet)

Çocukluğumdan beri, hakiki oldum (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide, oh, oh)
Eğer sen olsaydım, bileklerimi keserdim (Ah)
Tüm vücudunu XO dövmesi sarmış, evet (Vücudunu, evet)

Küçüklüğümden beri, hakiki oldum (Evet, ooh, yok)
Kızı salmalısın, özgür olmak istiyor (Oh, yok)

Ne söyledikleri önemli değil, ben zamansızım

Zamansız (Oh), zamansız, zamansız

Зажгу косяк в этой суке
Метро, Метро, Метро, три раза
Йеа

Следуем кодексу, все эти шлюхи созданы для улиц
Засунул ей в нос, теперь её киска потечёт
Ссыкуны стуканули, не увидят света дня
Может, щелчка и не слышно, но слышно, как эти челы вопят
Все мои шлюшки под грибами, бля, все мои шлюшки под коксом
Кольцо двадцать карат, засунул пальцы ей глубоко в рот (А, а, а)
Если карат пропадёт, она удавится (А, а, а)
Я знаю, она сглотнёт, она в этом G.O.A.T. (А, а, а)
Freeband, на хуй, тащи бабки сюда
Мои стрелки в углу, стоят стаей
Она думает, что она экзотическая сучка и поэтому красива
Из-за такого дерьма тебя вынесут на районе, брр
И девиз у нас всё тот же
Шикую, будто выиграл игру за чемпионство
Ты знаешь, как эти шлюхи голодны, они трахнутся за статус
Подтянул её в банду, она трахнулась за цепь
Твоя девка в этой суке, она вертится на члене
У меня сироп в этой суке, тусим в этой суке
Мы принесли Перки в эту суку, наебашимсь в этой суке
Вся эта ювелирка на мне, детка, ну что ж, время поиграть
Зови подружку, сучка, мы трахнем их одновременно
Я на другом уровне, нет, мы не одной породы
Можешь взять ту малую, если её ещё не взял я (Йеа)

Юный дилер, торгуешь дурью, реально ты таков? (Если ты таков)
Выбиваешь двери, вламываешься в двери, реально ты таков? (Йеа)
Юный пацан на кайфе, торгуешь дешёвкой, реально ты таков? (Йеа)
Весь 24-ый ты на ходу, реально ты таков? (Если ты таков)
Чуваки с самых низов реально таковы (Если ты таков)
Шагай в Баленсиаге, если ты таков (Если ты таков)
Выпей ещё бутылочку, если ты таков (Если ты таков)

Он когда-то был гангстером на своём районе

Эти чуваки треплются без умолку
Не вынимайте гроб из своего рта; я параноик, если мне летят угрозы
Эй-эй, за дело, бро
D-O-T, деньги, власть, уважение
Последнее — самое важное
Эй, так много дурачков с баблом на руках
Ну в смысле, а, надеюсь, что эти сантименты символичны
А, мой темперамент биполярен, я выбираю агрессию
Окей, поехали, пора ему доказать, какой он жёсткий
Чуваки объединяются, но ведут себя неискренне, никакого 40 Water, скажите им
А, йеа, ха, йеа, давай со мной
На хуй скрытые диссы, шутер от первого лица; надеюсь, там есть три переключателя
Я кричу: «На хуй рэп», запишу дисс на Мелли Мэла, если придётся
2Teez со мной рядом, срываю цепи и выжигаю тату, я готов
Потерял много бойцов, чтобы вести неосторожную игру
Если он расхаживает с палкой в руках, это не Andre 3K
Думаете, я не скину адрес? У меня до сих пор ПТСР
В жопу большую троицу, блять, здесь большой только я
Сука, бам
Чё? Я реально и есть таков
И твоя лучшая работа — это слабые потуги
Сука, Принц пережил Майкла Джексона
Сука, бам
Перед тем, как всех твоих псов похоронят
Это АК с девятками, он увидит кладбище домашних животных

Hva faen ser jeg ut som? Kom deg faen-meg ut av hans vei
Hawthorne er der han er fra, en annen planet er hvor han bor
Femten penger for det nyе fortet, jeg har hatt guap siden nittеn
Jeg spratt ut som chi-ching, jeg tror jeg er en djevel for helvete
Virkelig ballin’ i denne bitchen, jeg er den hardeste i denne bitchen
Gir faen i noe bjeff, jeg jager hunder opp i denne bitchen
El Segundo føltes som colosseum
P sa jeg kunne gjøre det, og man, jeg trodde på han
Jeg bygde en vei av frihet på grunn av de ordene han sa
Gi faen i tradisjon, stopp å imponer de døde, ah

Mamma, jeg skal klare det, fitte, jeg skal klare det

Takknemlighet sitter under overdreven stolthet som er på mine ermer
Mamma sa jeg var mhm, spesiell, jeg var mhm
Sprenger shit opp hjemme i Chromakopia, mhm
Jeg (Jeg), liker ikke (Liker ikke), hvordan dette ser ut (Nei)
Speilet har fått meg (Fått meg), tenkende på min bokstøtte (Jeg er ferdig)
Jeg trenger bare denne tiden for meg selv for å finne ut hvem jeg er-er
Skal jeg la lyset være på eller skal jeg bukke grasiøst?
Det er inni meg, bror

Oh, oh, oh (Du må aldri stoppe å være deg selv og demp aldri lyset for noen av de motherfuckerne der ute)

We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?

If every day I think about her
Yeah, every day of my life
Then tell me why I haven't found her
(Why, why, why, why, why?)

There's so many people to see (There's so many people to see)
And places to go (There's so many places to go)
I still haven't found your love

We nevеr met, but she's all I see at night
Nevеr met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?

I'll take her places they ain't found yet
I'll put it all on the line
I'll be that someone she can count on
One, two, three, four, five

There's so many people to see (There's so many people to see)

If there's another universe
Please make some noise (Noise)
Give me a sign (Sign)
This can't be life
If there's a point to losing love
Repeating pain (Why?)
It's all the same (Same)
I hate this place
Stuck in this paradigm
Don't believe in paradise
This must be what Hell is like
There's got to be more, got to be more
Sick of this head of mine
Intrusive thoughts, they paralyzе
Nirvana's not as advertised
Therе's got to be more, been here before

Ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Life's better on Saturn
Got to break this pattern
Of floating away
Ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Find something worth saving
It's all for the taking
I always say

I'll be better on Saturn
None of this matters
Dreaming of Saturn, oh

If karma's really real
How am I still here?
Just seems so unfair
I could be wrong though
If there's a point to being good
Then where's my reward?
The good die young and poor
I gave it all I could

Stuck in this terradome (Ooh)
All I see is terrible (Ooh)
Making us hysterical (Ooh)
There's got to be more, got to be more
Sick of this head of mine (Ooh)
Intrusive thoughts, they paralyze (Ooh)
Nirvana's not as advertised (Ooh)
There's got to be more, been here before

Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart
I wasn't there, but I know
She was your girl
You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go

She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me
You don't need to remind me
I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?

But I see her in the back of my mind all the time
Like a fever, like I’m burning alive, like a sign
Did I cross the line?
(Mm) Hmm

Well, good things don't last (Good things don't last)
And life moves so fast (Life moves so fast)
I'd never ask who was better (I'd never ask who was better)
'Cause she couldn't be (Couldn't)
More different from me (Different)
Happy and free in leather (Happy)

And I know that you love me (You love me)
You don’t need to remind me (Remind me)
Wanna put it all behind me, but baby

I see her in the back of my mind (Back of my mind) all the time (All the time)
Feels like a fever (Like a fever), like I’m burning alive (Burning alive), like a sign
Did I cross the line?

You say no one knows you so well (Oh)
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt
Valentine's Day, cryin’ in the hotel
I know you didn't mean to hurt me, so I kept it to myself
And I wonder
Do you see her in the back of your mind in my eyes?

Put it in the mouth, put it on the face, put it wherever you want
Put it in the mouth, put it on the face, put it wherever you want

The young dude looked at me and wanted to fuck my little pussy
Today, I'll give it to the young dude, fuck, fuck the "larissinha"
The young dude looked at me and wanted to fuck my little pussy
Today, I'll give it to the young dude, fuck, fuck the "larissinha"

Every time I try to run, you put your curse all over me
I surrender at your feet, baby, put it all on me
Every time I try to pray you away, you got me on my knees
I surrender at your feet, baby, put it all on me

I love it when you turn me on
I love it when you turn it on
I love it when you turn me on
So come back in and turn it on

Put it in the mouth, put it on the face, put it wherever you want (Turn me on)

(Turn me on) Today, I'll give it to the young dude, fuck, fuck the "larissinha"

Baby, ride me 'til the darkness of the night
Kill me softly like you want me euthanized, oh yeah

Hot like risin' sun, burnin' everything she touch
She don't even want your money, can buy you and someone else
She's addicted to the rush, I can never get enough
She desensitized to money, need to pay with something else

Baby, you turn me on
Baby, you turn me on
Baby, you turn me on
Girl, you turn me on

Hit it from the back, she louder than two sold-out nights
I think she fell in love, she said she trust me with her life, oh

Hot like risin' sun, burnin' everything she touch
She don't even want your money, can buy you and someone else
She's addicted to the rush, I could never get enough (Put it in the mouth, put it on the face, put it in the mouth, put it on the face)
She desensitized to money, need to pay with something else

Baby, turn me on (I love it when you turn me on)
I love it when you turn me on (I love it when you turn me on)
See how you turn me on? (I love it when you turn me on)
I love it when you turn me on, oh (So now I gotta turn it on)

La, da-da-da, da-da-la, la-da-da-da-da
La, da-da-da, da-da-da

If I told you how much I think about her
You'd think I was in love
And if you knew how much I looked at her pictures
You would think we're best friends

'Cause I know her star sign, I know her blood type
I've seen every movie she's been in, and, oh, God, she's beautiful
And I know you loved her, and I know I'm butthurt
But I can't help it, no, I can't help it

I'm so obsessed with your ex (Uh-huh)
I know she's been asleep on my side of your bed, and I can feel it
I'm starin' at her like I wanna get hurt
And I remember every detail you have evеr told me, so be careful, baby

I'm so obsеssed with your ex (Ah)
Yeah, I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
La, da-da-da, da-da-da

She's got those lips, she's got those hips
The life of every fuckin' party
She's talented, she's good with kids
She even speaks kindly about me, ha-ha

And I know you love me, and I know it's crazy
But, every time you call my name, I think you mistake me for her
You both have moved on, you don't even talk
But I can't help it, I got issues, I can't help it, baby

I'm so obsessed with your ex
I know she's been asleep on my side in your bed, and I can feel it
I'm starin' at her like I wanna get hurt
And I remember every detail you have ever told me, so be careful, baby

I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
Yeah, I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)

Is she friends with your friends? Is she good in bed?
Do you think about her? No, I'm fine, it doesn't matter, tell me
Is she easy-going? Never controlling?
Well-traveled? Well-read? Oh, God, she makes me so upset

I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
She's been asleep on my side of your bed (Ah), woah
I'm so obsessed with your ex (God, she makes me so upset)

How can it be? You and me
Might be meant to be, can't unsee it
But I don't wanna cause no scene
I'm usually so unproblematic
So independent, tell me why
'Cause the boy is mine, mine

Somethin' about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over (Over)
And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
Thе boy is mine
Watch me take my timе
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is mine

Please know this ain't what I planned for
Probably wouldn't bet a dime or my life on
There's gotta be a reason why
My girls, they always come through in a sticky situation
Say, "It's fine" (It's fine)
Happens all the time

Somethin' about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over (Over)
And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is—

And I know it's simply meant to be
And I, I take full accountability for all these tears
Promise you, I'm not usually like this
Shit, it's like news to me, to me
But I can't ignore my heart, boy

The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him (Oh, yeah)
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time

I was in a sheer dress the day that we met
We were both in a rush, we talked for a sec
Your friend hit me up so we could connect
And what are the odds? You send me a text
And now the next thing I know, I'm like
Manifest that you're oversized
I digress, got me scrollin' like
Out of breath, got me goin' like

Ooh (Ah)
Who's the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent? Like
Ooh (Ah)
Maybe it's all in my head

But I bеt we'd have really good bеd chem
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round
Oh, it just makes sense
How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things
That's bed (Bed) chem (Chem)
How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed
Are you free next week?
I bet we'd have really good

Come right on me, I mean camaraderie
Said you're not in my time zone, but you wanna be
Where art thou? Why not uponeth me?
See it in my mind, let's fulfill the prophecy

Ooh (Ah)
Who's the cute guy with the wide blue eyes and the big bad mm? Like
Ooh (Ah)
I know I sound a bit redundant

But I bet we'd have really good bed chem

Your blades are sharpened with precision
Flashing your favorite point of view
I know you're waiting in the distance
Just like you always do, just like you always do

Already pullin' me in
Already under my skin
And I know exactly how this ends, I

Let you cut me open just to watch me bleed
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be
Don't know why I'm hopin' for what I won't receive
Fallin' for the promise of the emptiness machine
The emptiness machine

Goin' around like a revolver
It's been decided how we lose
'Cause there's a fire under the altar
I keep on lyin' to, I keep on lyin' to

Already pullin' me in

Well, look what the stork brung
(What?) Little baby devil with the forked tongue
And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb
(Bleah) With a forehead that it grew horns from
Still a white jerk
Pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher with the vic's, percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician, an electrician y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me
If I was to ever take a leave, It would be aspirin to break a feve
If I was to ask for Megan Thee Stallion if she would collab with me
Would I really have a shot at a feat? (Ha!)
I don't know, but I'm glad to be back, like

Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh

Now back in the days of old me
(When) Right around the time I became a dope fiend
Ate some codeine, as a way of coping taste of opiates, case of O.E
​Turned me into smiley face emoji
My shit may not be age appropri—
Ate but I will hit an eight year old in the face with a participation trophy
'Cause I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout to turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out
To shut me down so when I started this verse
It did start off light-hearted at first
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed, look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all have been light joggin' and I've been running at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin, and I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best but ops I'm white-chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then
"Oh my god, it's him... not again!"

Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick, poof) Just like that and I'm back, bruh

Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say
(If what?) If he could see the way shit is today
(Look at this shit, man) He'd probably say that everything is gay
(Like happy!) What's my name, what's my name?

So, how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be
And that's why these words sting, just like you were being attacked by bees
In the coupe leaning back my seat
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group, the black guy pee's
In my Air Max 90's
White T's walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese
Identifies as black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' hacky sack I treat the whole world, 'cause I got it at my feet
How can I explain to you?
That even myself, I'm a danger too
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me what? Okay, that's it, go ahead, Paul, quit
Snake-ass prick, you male crossdresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that
(Watch) But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you, fuck my own kids they're brats (Fuck 'em)
They can screw-off, them and you all
You too, Paul, got two balls, big as RuPaul's, what you thought you saw ain't what you saw
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen
Like Sherri Papini, Harry Houdini, I vanish into the thin air as I'm leaving, like

Abra-abracadabra
(And for my last trick) I'm 'bout to reach in my bag, bruh
