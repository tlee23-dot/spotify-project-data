I want to serve the Senate
I guess the viking can be very close
Oh, do not touch the cat, heck, huh, la la la
Ooh, need to wake up, ooh, you're still asleep

Located in Orlando
Acute bleeding from the beginning is hot water, I'm taking a shower
He didn't know his name
I'm sorry, it's completely meaningless, that does not exist
Kuwait, Kuwait, sometimes we live in the sea
It's a beautiful tooth
His body fits into my ducks
Everything is wet, yes, yes

I want to serve the Senate
I guess the viking can be very close
Yes, no no no no, oh no God
Ooh, I want to run away
Oh, snoring knows Norita, dead
I want to get out of the house safely
Oh, do not touch the cat, heck, huh, la la la
Ooh, need to wake up, ooh, you're still asleep

Saved me at the hotel, there are jobs that don't change anyone
He did not claim to be a lover of Pastirago
But you do not know how to pet my insect friend
Be short, don't flirt with me, no

Yes honey, that's funny
Should we talk? Tea truck
Dear, you killed a child
Standby mode

I want to serve the Senate
I guess the viking can be very close
But there is a wall, the real story is la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Ooh, I want to run away
Oh, snoring knows Norita, dead
I want to get out of the house safely (Get out of this house safely)
Hi, there is something wrong with you, the real story is la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Ooh, need to wake up, ooh, you're still asleep

Wait, wait for me (Hey, wait up)
We hope this makes sense (No, it doesn't)
Call my name, I'm my dad
The wine has arrived, the wine has arrived, the wine has arrived

Duh you, duh you, duh you
Ooh, need to wake up, ooh, you're still asleep--------------------

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?" I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

My smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')

I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it

Found you when your heart was broke
I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own (Ooh)

I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me

It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you

Tu agis comme si tu avais besoin d'un rappel
Essayant de recommencer ça
Mais toutes ces paillettes ne sont pas de l’or, j'étais aveuglée
Je n'aurais jamais dû te donner mon coeur
You act like you need remindin’
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment

Et je ne peux pas croire que j'ai pu croire à tous ces mensonges
J'ai cru que tu étais miennе, mais pourtant tu as décidé d'être avec lui
Tu t'es еmparée de mes sentiments et tu les as juste jetés par la fenêtre
C'est comme si c'était trop dur de retomber amoureuse, non

Certaines nuits comme celle-ci, bébé, je ne peux pas m’empêcher de penser à nous
Je me le remémore, je bois, tu me manques
Est-ce que tu peux me dire pourquoi tout cet amour distant ?
Si j’appelais, est-ce que tu décrocherais ?
Certaines nuits comme celle-ci, je veux juste t'envoyer un message, mais à quoi bon ?
Tu vas dire que tu me veux, puis retourner ta veste
Juste jouer avec mes émotions juste parce que, non (Oh)

Toutes ces fois où j’ai fait l'imbécile pour toi
Pensant qu'on pourrait se remettre ensemble, pensant qu'on avait toute la vie devant nous
Tu n’as jamais vu ma perspective
Notre connexion est tellement endommagée, tu ne fais aucun effort

Et je ne peux pas croire que j'ai pu croire à tous ces mensonges
J'ai cru que tu étais mienne, mais pourtant tu as décidé d'être avec lui
Tu t'es emparée de mes sentiments et tu les as juste jetés par la fenêtre
C'est comme si c'était trop dur de retomber amoureuse, non

Certaines nuits comme celle-ci, bébé, je ne peux pas m'empêcher de penser à nous

Tu vas me donner des faux espoirs, meuf
Tu vas me donner des faux espoirs, meuf
Tu vas juste me dire encore plus de mensonges, meuf
Tu vas juste me donner des faux espoirs, meuf

J'ai été bien trop bon avec toi, tu m'as pris pour acquis
Tu étais mon premier jour depuis la fois à Big B's house sur Adams
Le premier jour où on s'est rencontré-e-s, je t'ai faite signe, je t'ai dit, "Appelle-moi"
Tu me promettais que tu ne me trahirais jamais comme une Gémeau
Tu penses que je suis con, mais personne n'est stupide
Je vois tous les signes, je vois tous les indices
Ouais, parfois je me rappelle de cette merde quand je bois
Je ne peux pas croire que ça fait toute une année ouais, mais

Set fire to my purpose
And I let it burn
You got off on the hurting
When it wasn't yours, yeah

I needed to lose you to find me
This dancing was killing me softly

أنت تعلم ذلك، أوه، كلينا نعلم ذلك
تلك السجائر التي تعالج همومنا
ذلك المنزل المحترق، ليس هناك ما تبقى

لدينا طول الليل لنقع في الحب
ولكن تماماً هكذا، أنفصلنا
نحن محطمين، نحن محطمين

مم، لا شيء، لا شيء، لا شيء سينقذنا الآن

حسناً، هناك صمت محطم

Green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little company from me
But if you got everything figured out like you say
Don't waste a minute, don't wait a minute
It's only a matter of time for you-ooh-ooh-ooh to-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me now, 'cause I've been up for, I've been up for

Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want (Want)
And you can call me names if you call me up (Call me up)
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up (Ooh)

I can't fix each and all your problems
I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved, she stopped returnin' my calls
Her flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone in all the wrong ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music, watchin' movies, talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head, just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money, maybe someday, you can take it from me?
I'm up too late thinkin' 'bout you in MIA for

Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want (Want)
And you can call me names if you call me up (Call me up)
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the City of Palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up (Ooh)--------------------

Estoy tan cansado de canciones de amor, cansado de canciones de amor
Cansado de canciones de amor, cansado del amor
Sólo quiero ir a casa, quiero ir a casa
Quiero ir a casa, whoa

De fiesta, haciendo mi mejor esfuerzo para conocer a alguien
Pero todos a mi alrededor se están enamorando de nuestra canción
Yo, yo, oh, sí
Lo odio, tomo mi oportunidad porque no puedo soportarlo
Pero no creo que hagan nada tan fuerte, así que me aferro
Yo, yo, oh, sí

Estoy tan cansado de canciones de amor, cansado de canciones de amor
Cansado de canciones de amor, cansado del amor
Sólo quiero ir a casa, quiero ir a casa

Y cuando se van vuelvo a nuestra canción, me aferro
Yo, yo, oh yo
Duele como el cielo, perdido en el sonido

No puedo perderte y te necesito ahora

I'm losing my self-control
Yeah, you’re starting to trickle back in
But I don't wanna fall down the rabbit hole
Cross my heart, I won't do it again

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
And I think of you

Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess
But wasn't it the best?
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it's never really over

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again
Just because it’s over doesn’t mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you’ll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

I guess I could try hypnotherapy
I gotta rewire this brain
'Cause I can't even go on the internet
Without even checking your name

I tell myself, tell myself, tell myself, "Draw the line"
And I do, I do
But once in a while, I trip up, and I cross the line
I think of you

Two years and just like that
My head still takes me back
Thought it was done, but I
Guess it’s never really over
Oh, we were such a mess

Just because it's over doesn't mean it's really over
And if I think it over, maybe you'll be coming over again
And I'll have to get over you all over again

Thought we kissed goodbye
Thought we meant this time was the last
But I guess it's never really over
Thought we drew the line right through you and I
Can't keep going back
I guess it's never really over, yeah

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover--------------------

What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)

Bury a friend, I wanna end me
I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna… end me

Getting hot, losing control
You want me more now I let go
Now, now, now, now

I'm over you and I don't need your lies no more
'Cause the truth is, without you, boy, I'm stronger
And I know you said that I changed with my cold heart
But it was your game that left scars
Ooh, I'm over you

Don't call me up
I'm going out tonight
Feeling good now you're outta my life

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

I'm drunk in the back of the car

This song was later officially remixed by Alec and featured GRAMMY award-winning artist, Alessia Cara.
This night is cold in the kingdom
I can feel you fade away
From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
Your steps keep me awake

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
As I'm walking down the corridor
And I know we haven't talked in a while
So I'm looking for an open door

Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly

And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down
And I can't stop myself from falling down

Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving, baby, let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely

Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like

And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM

But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

You need to calm down, you're being too loud

Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud

We all know now we all got crowns

난 말하지 운명 따윈 처음부터 내 게 아니었다고 (Oh no)
세계의 평화 (No way)
거대한 질서 (No way)
그저 널 지킬 거야 난

Listen my my baby 나는
저 하늘을 높이 날고 있어

툭 까놓고 말할게
나도 모르게 힘이 들어가기도 했어
높아버린 sky, 커져버린 hall
때론 도망치게 해달라며 기도했어
But 너의 상처는 나의 상처
깨달았을 때 나 다짐했던걸 (Yeah)
니가 준 이카루스의 날개로 (Uh)
태양이 아닌 너에게로
Let me fly

Oh my my my, oh my my my
I've waited all my life (All my life)
네 전부를 함께하고 싶어
Oh my my my, oh my my my (Oh, oh)
Looking for something right (Right)

If you don't wanna see me

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Hair toss, check my nails

Woo, child, tired of the bullshit
Go on, dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes, Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going-to-the-pool shit
Come now, come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it's hard, but you have to try
If you need advice, let me simplify

If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door

Gotta take a deep breath, time to focus on you
All the big fights, long nights that you been through
I got a bottle of tequila I been saving for you
Boss up and change your life
You can have it all, no sacrifice
I know he did you wrong, we can make it right
So go and let it all hang out tonight

'Cause he don't love you anymore
So walk your fine ass out the door

Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded
By the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over
Well, there must be something in the tide

I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
And I'm tired of being so exhausted
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Even though I'm nothing to you now
Even though I'm nothing to you now

There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under
There must be something in the water
