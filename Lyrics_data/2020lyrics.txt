Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite--------------------

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Yeah, ayy)
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Ayy, yeah)

I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on Mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed

Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"

If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"

Baby, I already found out, it's noticeable when you look at me
There where you haven't reached, you know I'll take you there
Tell me what you want to drink, you are my baby
And who is going to talk about us if we don't let ourselves be seen?

And sometimes it's Dolce, sometimes Bulgari
When I take it off of you after the parties
The glasses of wine, the pounds of weed
You're really loose, I'm on a safari
You shake your ass phenomеnal
So I can devour you like an animal
If you haven't arrivеd, I'll wait for you
In my bed and I'll celebrate

Baby, I don't go against you
And I always give it to you
And if you hit me up, we're going to swim in the deep end
If it were up to me I'd give it to you
From September to August
And I don't give a fuck about what your friends say

You got me hooked, yeah
If you were an Urus, you'd have me parked
Going around Condado with you always high
You aren't my woman, but
Take five thousand, spend it on Sephora
Louis Vuitton, she doesn't buy Pandora anymore
Like a piercing, she puts holes in men, eh-eh-eh

A while a go they broke her heart (Her heart)
Studious, set to be a doctor (Doctor)
But (But), she likes the guys doing wheelies on motorcycles (Motorcyles)
I'm for you all twenty-four hours

Baby, I don't go against you
And I always give it to you (I always give it to you)
And if you hit me up, we're going to swim in the deep end (Swim in the deep end)

1 ContributorSlapā puse (Cardi B - WAP feat. Megan Thee Stallion LV cover) LyricsEs saku diņkapauri, tu!
Katru dienu tu!
Slapā pusē
Īsti ielikt nemāki, nu!
Jē, jē, jē, jē, jē
Tu fukājies ar neīsto pusi
Atnes lupatu un spaini
Jo man slapā puse
Ieliec visu, kas tev ir
Manā slapā pusē
Bīdi ritmu, itkā saceļās
Ekstra liels un ekstra sārts
Met to peten' tieši sejā
Liec to degun' iekšā ejā
Augšā lejā, tā man jāj
Tā man patīk, nepārstāj
Skaties man acīs, mutē spļauj
Nodžummī makstī, jā es ļauj
Sien mani striķī, lai es bļauj
Lomu spēle, masku auj
Es gribu, lai no-par-ko
To fūri šaurajā garāžā man
Diņķis krīmo, es tik skrīmo
Bize vaļā, tā es dzīvo
Ne es cep, ne es tīru
Jo šis ir veids kā tikt pie vīra

====
Ēd mani, rij mani
Iekšā aicinu pirms tev sula nāk
Izvelc bеciņu, parādīšu tev
Kur novietot sēkliņu, kamēr
Nika skrien to pеlmeni
Tev vajag viņam dirst, lūpā kod
Noslauc piķi, kamēr grūzmī dod
Nedod savu Ilzīti tāpat vien
Lai samaksā par īri pirms iekšā lien
Tāpēc ņem, kamēr var
Savu slapo pusi
Būs tev aifons ar ko bildēt
Savu slapo pusi
Maksā īri, ja tu sūknēt
Gribi slapo pusi
Liec, lai naktī saule spīd
Ja gribi slapo pusi

Jē, jē, jē, jē, jē
Tu fukājies ar neīsto pusi
Atnes lupatu un spaini

Ieliec visu, kas tev ir

Lai tik pil, lai tik pil
Mana slapā puse
Atnes lupatu un spaini
Jo man slapā puse
Lai tik pil pil pil
Mana slapā puse
Makaroni katlā vārās
Jo man slapā puse, ha!--------------------

Я внутри тебя словно стрела
Хотела быть лучше - не смогла
Ты никому больше не нужна
Кем тогда ты заменишь меня?

Вижу мир открыто как наркоман
Я тебя вообще не забывал, я
Я с тобой играю, но ты не игра
Тебе одиноко, я спасу тебя
Ничего не жалко, ничё не боюсь
Я юзаю что могу, я тебя люблю
Нет одежды на тебе, в тебе я как в раю
И мы забудем то что было это наяву
Будто бы рокстар, я не работаю, мне похер
На мне маленькие суммы, чувствую себя на тропе
Сердце перестало биться, и там холодно как хоккей
Это цели, а не деньги, биг бой в дороге

Попаду в рай, сука, попаду в рай
Сука, много грешил, но я попаду в рай
Будто рокстар, сука попаду в рай
Я останусь легендой, как не станет меня

1 ContributorMood (feat. iann dior)  Lyrics
What's up everybody it's 24kGoldn, I'm really proud of this.. I spent hours and hours designing the world.. Picking the songs, re-recording new vocals.. Rehearsing all the moves and dressed like i'm about to go deep in the metaverse just for y'all... See you soon, I gotta get on stage
What's up Robloxians! How you guys doing today? What's good? What's good? Oh i like your outfit over there! Now, if you don't know, My name is 24kGoldn and it's an incredible honor to put on this concert for y'all today... But before we get started with any music.. I got to put you on.. A little secret.. You see this? This is called a relic. I've hidden five of them across the entire concert.. And if you can collect them all you're gonna get a special reward.. Now, because I'm a nice guy.. The first one is a freebie. Thank me later for that. Uh, this first song we're going to get into is one of my favorites, it's a very special song to me.. You might have heard it before and it's called "Mood". And to do this song i'm gonna need my golden microphone

Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah)

Why you always in a mood?
Messin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playin' by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Messin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playin' by your rules
Everything look better with a view, yeah

I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Someone I was into end up feelin' bad
Baby, I am not your dad
What more do you want from me
I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confu-

Uh... Who are you? No, seriously, Who are you? Hey! ouch.. What are you- Hey! That's my microphone! I'll take this.. No you won't!
What? I can't do the show without my microphone.. Uh.. Let me think.. I got an idea.. Come on y'all.. Let's get in the car--------------------

If all of the kings had their queens on the throne

Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
I'll show you how a real queen behaves (Oh)

No damsel in distress, don't need to save me
Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me
And you might think I'm weak without a sword
But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours

But I'm stronger than I ever was before

Baby, you're not dancing on your own

In chess, a king can move one space at a time
But queens are free to go wherever they like
You get too close, you'll get a royalty high
So breathe it in to feel alive

Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me

I'm everything they said I would be
La, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
Oh, ah, ah
Ah, oh

I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything (Everything)
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me, oh

Oh
Ooh, ooh

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love

Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Break down
Tear me up inside
When you break me down--------------------

Me in your sweater, you said it looked better
On me than it did you, only if you knew
How much I liked you, but I watch your eyes as she

Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better, wish I were Heather
Watch as she stands with her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

Buena en todos lados, no te preocupes por no ser aceptada

No necesitas un patrocinador, no, eres la marca ahora
Eres mi roca, mi Colorado
Consigue ese anillo, como Toronto
Te amo ahora, un poco más mañana
Así es cómo me siento, actúa como si supieras qué eres

Imagen perfecta, no necesitas filtro
Hermosa, hazlos caer muertos, eres una asesina
Dúchate con toda mi atención
Sí, estas son mis únicas intenciones
Quédate en la cocina cocinando, obtén tu propio pan (Azotarlo)

Los dos tenemos que admitirlo (Ambos)
Es divertido que ambos escuchemos (Ambos)
Es una bendición (Bendición) porque los dos lo obtenemos (Ambos)
Eres lo mejor (Wuh), y no necesito un testigo (Lo mejor)
Voy a buscar un anillo y rezar para que te quede perfecto (Perfecto, perfecto)

Imagen perfecta, no necesitas filtro (Sin filtro)
Hermosa, hazlos caer muertos, eres una asesina (Oh-oh)
Dúchate con toda mi atención (Lo haré)
Sí, estas son mis únicas intenciones (Sí)
Quédate en la cocina cocinando, obtén tu propio pan (Tú lo haces)
Corazón lleno de equidad, eres una activa (Ajá)
Asegúrate de no necesitar menciones (Sin menciones)
Sí, estas son mis únicas intenciones (Únicas intenciones)

Únicas intenciones

Lyrics for 'Life Is Good (feat. Drake)' by Future,Drake:
1 ContributorFuture & Drake - Life is Good (Azərbaycanca Tərcümə) Lyrics

Həftəsonu işləyirəm, həmişəki kimi
Ayıq deyiləm yenə, həmişəki kimi
Oğlanlar bizi ötdüklərindən əmindirlər, özlərini çox dartırlar
Vergilərimi həll etmədim, beynim çöndü
Biləyimdəki Patek Virgil-dəndir
Oğlanlar bir dəfə bekar vaxtımda məni tutdular, hə, n'olsun?
Kimsə bölgəvi taradı, biz olsaydıq deyərdim
Rosewood-da malikanəm var, çox lüks şeydir

Sayılı günlərim qalıb dedilər, amma hər səhər əvvəlki kimi oyanıram
Bilirəm mesajlarımı görürsən, balam, nə olar, mənə nəsə yaz
Şərab qədəhdə, sənin sevgilin yaman pul hərisidir
Oğlanlar albomumun tarixini yönləndirməyə məcburdur
Qancıq, bu şöhrətdir, prim deyil
Bilmirəm məsələ nədir amma danışığına fikir ver
Civinin eqosu evinin 2 qatı boydadır
Bir söz deyə bilmərəm ona, belədir, neynim
Deməli olduğum şeyi dedim, etməli olduğum şeyi etdim
FBG-yə heç vaxt arxa çevirmədim
Biləyimdəki Patek-i Virgil düzəldib, həşəmətlidir
Nömrəmi sənə verərəm amma gic-gic şeylərdən ötrü məni dəng etmə

Həftəsonu işləyirəm, həmişəki kimi
Ayıq deyiləm yenə, həmişəki kimi
Oğlanlar bizi ötdüklərindən əmindirlər, özlərini çox dartırlar
Vergilərimi həll etmədim, beynim çöndü
Biləyimdəki Patek Virgil-dəndir
Oğlanlar bir dəfə bekar vaxtımda məni tutdular, hə, n'olsun?
Kimsə bölgəvi taradı, biz olsaydıq deyərdim
Rosewood-da malikanəm var, çox lüks şeydir

Bu çox zordu dostum, qırmızı dabanlı ayağımdadır
Həyat bombadır, başa düşdün də özün


Hə, civi, barmağımdakı ən ucuz üzük də yüz min dollardır, woo
Mühitimə salmaq üçün bir dənəsini ilk təyyarəylə İspaniyaya göndərdim, woo
Bir də, qıza Audеmar aldım
Üzüyə üç min verdim, civi, bunun adı Bentley SUV-dur, woo
Məkanda kokain satırdım, o hadisədən sonra başını buraxdım, woo

Mən kiloluq kokonu satanda nənəm düz orda dayanıb mənə baxırdı, woo
Taliban bazarınızda o oğlanları yönləndirirəm, woo
Sipər aldım, yanımda tapançayla maşın sürdüyüm vaxtlar olub, woo
Kim vеrib sənə həbləri? Kim verib sənə kleyi? Pluto səni soyğuna göndərib, woo
Burdakı məhbuslar bu işə girmək üçün məni dəvət etdilər, woo
Axmaqlıq etməkdən çəkinirəm, Osama-nı tarayırlar, woo
Şam işığı yandırmağa məcbur qaldılar, oğlan, hamı vurula bilər, woo
İqamətgahlarda içi marixuana dolu Backwood-u yandırıram, woo
Londonda əlavə daraqlı Draco-nu ortaya çıxarıram, woo
O oğlanın ağzının payını verməlidirlər, biz bunun üçün öləcəyik
Hə, adamlarım üçün hücuma keçirəm, qızıma yalan satıram, woo
Biz kasıb, üst təbəqə adamlarıq, bacardıq, varlı olduq, hə
Bahalı məkandaydım, qarderob üçün çardağı kirayələdim, woo
Boynumdakı və biləyimdəki qəndil kimidir, woo
Məndə ağ qadınlar var, xarici dildə danışırlar, woo
Qanımda Prometazin və Percocet var, hə

Hə, civi, barmağımdakı ən ucuz üzük də yüz min dollardır, woo
Mühitimə salmaq üçün bir dənəsini ilk təyyarəylə İspaniyaya göndərdim, woo
Bir də, qıza Audemar aldım
Üzüyə üç min verdim, civi, bunun adı Bentley SUV-dur, woo
Məkanda kokain satırdım, o hadisədən sonra başını buraxdım, woo

Tonlarla minliklərim var, onlara Serena deyirəm
Diri pullar üçün meydana atılıram
Hamısı orjinaldır, çəhrayı rəngli brilyant üzüyüm var
Hamısı orjinaldır, Fiji-dən sifariş etmişik
Şeydən basıb hallanmışam, şeydən basıb hallanmışam, hansınız işləyir burda?
Üzünü xəbərlərə çıxararam, bu amcığı T-Shirt-lərə yapışdıraram
Qaqaşın torbasını tikəndən sonra adamlarım gedib cənazə maşınını da tarayır, bu mənə kokonun 4-də 1 kilosuna başa gəldi, fəqət buna dəyərdi
Sən manyaksan, lənətə gəlmiş yadplanetlisən, necə israfçılıq edəcəksən?
Pişiyim yanımdadır, onunla əylənirəm, gedib Birkin alacam ona

Hə, civi, barmağımdakı ən ucuz üzük də yüz min dollardır, woo

You broke me first, ah

Maybe you don't like talkin' too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinkin' 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple months, so you're callin' me now
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I coulda ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

Good, feeling good

Ayy, feeling good, like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Yeah, ayy, ayy)

Every day can be a better day, despite the challenge
All you gotta do is leave it better than you found it
It's gonna get difficult to stand, but hold your balance
I just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it 'cause

Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

Ayy, feeling good like I should
Went and took a walk around the neighborhood
Feeling blessed, never stressed
Got that sunshine on my Sunday best (Ayy)

Some days you wake up and nothing works, you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears just like the waves and sound did
And just say whatever 'cause there is no way around it

Everyone falls down sometimes
But you just gotta know it'll all be fine
It's okay, uh-huh-huh, uh
It's okay, it's okay

Went and took a walk around the neighborhood

Hablando conmigo misma en el espejo como: "Perra, eres mi bebé"
Soy la mejor, uh
Necesito un trapeador para limpiar el piso, es demasiado goteo, uh
Tengo un nudo, tengo un reloj, tengo un carro, uh (Sigo auténtica, uh)
Juguemos un juego, Simón dice que sigo siendo esa perra, ey
Sigo siendo esa perra, sí (Ah)

Soy una salvaje (Okey)
Con clase, burguesa, de barrio (Okey)
Descarada, malhumorada, sucia, sí
Actuando estúpido, ¿qué está pasando? (Ah)
Perra, ¿qué está pasando? (Ah, ¿qué pasa?)
Perra, soy una salvaje, sí (Okey)
Con clase, burguesa, de barrio, sí (Woah, woah, woah, okey)
Descarada, malhumorada, sucia, jah (Uh, uh)
Actuando estúpido, ¿qué está pasando? (Uh, uh, ah)
Perra, ¿qué está pasando? (Ey, ah, ah)

Escuché que le pedían a la Reina que comprara algunas cámaras aquí
Soy una perra mala, ella es una salvaje, no hay comparación aquí
Me volteo el pelo y miro hacia atrás mientras perreo en el espejo
Todo este dinero en la habitación, creo que hay algunos estafadores aquí
Vine del Third, azoto el carro como si lo hubiera agitado (Agitado)
Woodgrain, estamos dando vueltas, manteniendo su mente en todas estas curvas (Ah)
El coupé vuela como un ave (Ave), frío en ellos como: "Brrr" (Brr)
Siempre cumplo mi palabra, no, no hago palabras cruzadas
Stallion con el montando, como las chicas calientes, esas caderas, ah (Skrrt, skrrt)
Entro en esa mierda, la forma en que salí y me deslicé, ah (Skrrt, skrrt)
Hago estallar mi mierda, ahora mírame estallar, estallar de nuevo, ah (Woah)
Limpié el piso, ahora mírame barrer estos millones, porque yo—(Ah)

Soy una salvaje, sí (Salvaje, okey)
Con clase, burguesa, de barrio, sí (Okey)
Descarada, malhumorada, sucia, sí (Sucia)
Actuando estúpido, ¿qué está pasando? (¿Qué está pasando?)
Perra, ¿qué está pasando? (Ahh, ¿qué pasa?)
Perra, soy una salvaje, sí (Okey, soy una salvaje)
Con clase, burguesa, de barrio, sí (Woah, woah, woah, okey, perra)
Descarada, malhumorada, sucia, jah (Sí, sí, sucia)

Du stellst mich auf ein Podest und sagst mir, ich bin der Beste
Hebst mich hoch in den Himmel, bis die Luft dünn wird (Yeah)
Füllst mich auf mit Selbstvertrauen, ich sag', was in meiner Brust ist
Verschüttest meine Worte und reißt mich nieder, bis nichts mehr übrig ist
Ordnest die Stücke neu an, damit sie zu mir passen, yeah

Aber was wenn ich, wenn ich stolpere?
Was wenn ich, wenn ich falle?
Bin ich dann das Monster?
Lass es mich einfach wissen
Und was wenn ich, wenn ich sündige?
Und was wenn ich, wenn ich zusammenbreche? Yeah
Bin ich dann das Monster? Yeah
Lass es mich einfach wissen, yeah

Ich war fünfzehn, als die Welt mich auf ein Podest stellte
Ich hatte große Träume, Shows zu spielen und Erinnerungen zu schaffen
Brachte einige schlechte Aktionen, um cool zu wirken, verärgert über ihren Neid, uh
Sie hoben mich hoch (Hoben mich hoch), hoben mich hoch (Yeah)
Und rissen mich nieder (Nieder), rissen mich nieder (Nieder, nieder)
Ich werde die Verantwortung übernehmen, für alles, was ich tat (Yeah)
Verübelst es mir (Yeah), als wärst du der Heilige (Yeah)

Ich war egoistisch, musste das loswerden
Weil der Hass sie kontrolliert
Ich kam rein mit guten Absichten, dann lies ich sie los
Und jetzt will ich wirklich wissen

Was wenn ich, wenn ich stolpere? (Oh)
Was wenn ich, wenn ich falle? (Ich falle)
Bin ich dann das Monster? (Bin ich das Monster?)
Lass es mich einfach wissen (Lass es mich wissen)
Und was wenn ich, wenn ich sündige? (Oh)
Und was wenn ich, wenn ich zusammenbreche?
Bin ich dann das Monster? (Bin ich das Monster?)
Lass es mich einfach wissen (Oh, bitte, lass es mich einfach wissen, yeah)

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)

Lyrics for 'Tusa' by KAROL G,Nicki Minaj:
1 ContributorTUSA (KAROL G & Nicki Minaj) Cover LyricsO-O-Ovy On The Drums
Ya no tiene excusa
Hoy salió con su amiga, dizque pa' matar la tusa
Que porque un hombre le pagó mal
Está dura y abusa
Se cansó de ser buena, ahora es ella quien los usa
Que porque un hombre le pagó mal
Ya no se le ve sentimental
Dice que por otro man no llora, no
Pero si le ponen la canción
Le da una depresión tonta
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón
¿Será porque con otra está
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar?
Pero hice todo este llanto por nada
Ahora soy una chica mala
And now you kickin' and screamin', a big toddler
Don't try to get your friends to come holla, holla
Ayo, I used to lay low
I wasn't in the clubs, I was on my JO
Until I realized you a epic fail
So don't tell your guys that I'm still your bae YO
'Cause it's a new day, I'm in a new place
Gettin' some new D, sittin' on a new face
'Cause I know I'm the baddest bitch you ever really met
You searchin' for a badder bitch, and you ain't met her yet
A yo, tell 'em to back off, he wanna slack off
Ain't no more booty calls, you gotta jack off
It's me and Karol G, we let them rats talk
Don't run up on on us 'cause they lettin' the macks off

Pero si le ponen la canción
Le da una depresión tonta
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón
¿Será porque con otra está
Fingiendo que a otra se puede amar? eh-uh
Un shot pa' la pena profunda
Y seguimo' gastando la funda
Otro shot pa' la mente
Pa' que el recuerdo no la atormente
Ya no le copia nada
Su ex ya no vale nada
Se va pa' la disco y solo quiere perrear
Pero se confunde cuando empieza a tomar
Ella se cura con rumba
Y el amor pa' la tumba
To' los hombre' le zumban
Pero si le ponen la canción
Le da una depresión tonta
Llorando lo comienza a llamar
Pero él la dejó en buzón
¿Será porque con otra está
Creyendo que a otra se puede amar?

You know that sometimes I think about us now and then
But I never wanna fall again, ah
I wouldn't want to forget you (Eh-eh)
But with you it's everything or nothing (Eh-eh)
Yeah-yeah

You're deep in the water, yeah, you're drownin' us
You question my love like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up
You regret it now but it's your mistake
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know
You know you messed up

One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'
Baby, you'll knock at my door
One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till to the end
One day you'll beg me to try
One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend

Come just a little bit closer
'Cause I want you to stay with me
Leave your friends behind over there, we're going on a secret trip
We're going to Turks and Caicos
And there we'll calm our desires down
Get loose with me, baby
'Cause there's no going back
A night without you
Is not that easy, baby
'Cause I'm for you
And you're for me

Never stop loving me
Oh, na-na-na
With you forever, baby
I don't want to leave you this time

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know that I'm in your heart, maybe deep down
Another girl writes to me, I never respond to her (No)
Life turns and the world is round
And I'm going to kiss you again in London
Or if not in Marbella (Woo!)
On top of the sand watching the stars (Yeah)
I know that not even the waves have erased my footprint (Yeah)
But you ignoring me is what gets me down
Sun, beach and in the sand, let's go there (Woo!)
Baby, don't stay quiet
I know that you want to grind with me
Again you've got me in depression
Smoking in the room, eh
But I know that

One day you'll love me again (Woo!)
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'

Find someone that loves you
Better than I do, darling, I know

Puedo verte de pie, cariño
Con sus brazos alrededor de tu cuerpo
Riéndote, pero la broma no es nada graciosa
Y te tomó sólo cinco minutos
Para olvidarte de nosotros y dejarme con todo eso
Manteniendo todo este amor aquí en el pasillo

Creo que he visto esta película antes
Y no me gustó el final
Y ya no eres mi problema
Entonces, ¿a quién estoy defendiendo ahora?
Eras mi ciudad, ahora estoy en el exilio, mirándote de lejos
Creo que he visto esta película antes

Uhh, uhh, uhh

Puedo verte mirándome, cariño
Como si él fuera sólo tú remplazo
Como si tus nudillos sangraran por mí
La segunda, la tercera y la centésima oportunidad
Nos balanceamos sobre ramas frágiles
Esa mirada son un insulto para las heridas

Creo que he visto esta película antes
Y no me gustó el final
Ya no soy tu problema
Entonces, ¿a quién estoy ofendiendo ahora?
Eras mi corona, ahora estoy en el exilio, mirándote de lejos
Creo que he visto esta película antes
Así que, me iré por la puerta lateral

Así que vete ya, no existe la cantidad
De lágrimas que pueda llorar por ti
Todo este tiempo
Siempre caminamos sobre una línea muy delgada
Ni siquiera me escuchaste
(Ni siquiera me escuchaste)
Nunca diste una señal de advertencia (Yo di tantas señales)
Todo este tiempo
Nunca aprendí a entender tu mentalidad (Nunca aprendiste a entender mi mentalidad)
No podía cambiar las cosas (Nunca cambiaste las cosas)
Porque nunca diste una señal de advertencia (Di tantas señales)
Tantas señales, tantas señales
Ni siquiera viste las señales
