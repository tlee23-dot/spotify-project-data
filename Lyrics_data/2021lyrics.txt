When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm

You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah (Fuck you)
(Ah)
(Goddamn)
(Ah)
(Fuck you)
(Fuck you)--------------------

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu--------------------

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo' edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent"
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always
Always inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations
I disappear if you let me
Feelin' like, yeah (On your own)
Feelin' like Jericho
Feelin' like Job when he lost his shit
Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I
Ooh, played and dipped, way to kill the mood
Know you like that shit
Can't groove it, ba-baby
Heavy on my empty mind shit

I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (Rest of me)
Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, "Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent" (It's urgent)
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind (My mind)
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in
Good days, good days, always (Good days on my mind, good days on my mind)
Sunny inside (Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)
Good day living in my mind

Gotta get right
Tryna free my mind before the end of the world
I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text
I choose not to respond
I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened
Half of us layin' waste to our youth, it's in the present
(Na-na, na-na, na-na, na)
Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now

Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind
You've been making me feel like I'm
Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind--------------------

Przytulamy się i, tak, kochamy
I zawsze po prostu mów dobranoc (La-la-la-la-la-la)
I przytulamy się, jasne, uwielbiam to
Ale potrzebuję twoich ust na moich

Czy możesz mnie więcej pocałować?
Jesteśmy tacy młodzi, chłopcze, nie mamy nic do stracenia, oh-oh
To tylko zasada
Kochanie, przytul mnie, bo podoba mi się sposób, w jaki się rowujesz, oh-oh

Chłopcze, piszesz swoje imię, ja mogę zrobić to samo
Och, uwielbiam ten smak, la-la-la-la-la-la
Wszystko na moim języku, chcę tego (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Chłopcze, piszesz swoje imię, ja mogę zrobić to samo
Och, uwielbiam ten smak, la-la-la-la-la-la
Wszystko na moim języku, chcę tego (La-la-la-la-la-la)

Ja, czuję się jak kurwa coś
Ale moglibyśmy być ckli, pieprzyć to
Cukier, nie jestem głupkiem, głupkiem
Lubię mówić, "A co jeśli?" Ale jeśli
Moglibyśmy się pocałować i po prostu pokroić śmieci
Wtedy mogę być na czymś
Nie dam ci jеdnego publicznie
Daję ci setki, piеprzyć to
Coś, w co po prostu musimy się dostać
Znak pierwszy, środkowy, ostatni na zębie mądrości
Czarnuchy żałują, że cipka jest budką do pocałunku
Spróbuj śniadania, lunchu, ginu i soku
I ta kolacja też jak deser
A kiedy my Francuzi, odśwież, daj mi dwa
Kiedy przygryzę tę wargę, przyjdź po mnie też
Chce szminkę, błyszczyk do ust, malinkę też, huh

Czy możesz mnie więcej pocałować?
Jesteśmy tacy młodzi, chłopcze, nie mamy nic do stracenia, oh-oh
To tylko zasada
Kochanie, przytul mnie, bo podoba mi się sposób, w jaki się rowujesz, oh-oh

Chłopcze, piszesz swoje imię, ja mogę zrobić to samo
Och, uwielbiam ten smak, la-la-la-la-la-la
Wszystko na moim języku, chcę tego (La-la-la-la-la-la)
Chłopcze, piszesz swoje imię, ja mogę zrobić to samo
Och, uwielbiam ten smak, la-la-la-la-la-la
Wszystko na moim języku, chcę tego

Powiedz, daj mi złotówkę, potrzebuję tych gushy rzeczy
Przesuń granicę, nie, nie jesteś wystarczająco dobry
Wszystkie twoje czarnuchy mówią, że przegrałeś beze mnie
Wszystkie moje suki czują się, jakbym unikł hrabstwa
Pieprzyć się z tobą czuć się jak więzienie, czarnuchu (Czuj się jak więzienie)
Nie mogę nawet wydychać, czarnuchu (Wydech)
Cipka jak święty Graal, wiesz o tym (Święty Graal)
Sprawisz, że będę potrzebował kaucji, wiesz o tym
Przyłapany na zanurzaniu się z twoim przyjacielem
Nie jesteś nawet w połowie, człowieku, kłamiesz na swoim ****, wiesz o tym
Kupiłem mi torbę pełną cegły, wiesz o tym
Kontroluj, nie zwalniaj tempa, jeśli odrzucę
Cały ten tyłek naprawdę (Cały ten tyłek)
Dramat sprawia, że czujesz (Sprawić, że czujesz)
Fantazja i bicz to wszystko, co mogę ci dać

Czy możesz mnie więcej pocałować?
Jesteśmy tacy młodzi, chłopcze, nie mamy nic do stracenia, oh-oh
To tylko zasada
Kochanie, przytul mnie, bo podoba mi się sposób, w jaki się rowujesz, oh-oh
Och, kochanie

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)

You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you

Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby

So put your loving hand out, darlin'

Ridin' high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me, no
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I plant and seed, just let me go
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'

And put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I wanna paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors
Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'

Mmm, yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

I'm fightin' hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black

I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your lovin' hand out, darlin'

You hit me with a call to your place
Ain't been out in a while anyway
Was hopin' I could catch you throwin' smiles in my face
Romantic talkin'? You don't even have to try
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Lookin' at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you livin' the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right

Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

Mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm

Ayy, ayy
I wanna sell what you're buyin'
I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
I want that jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'
Oh, oh, oh, why me?
A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shinin' on me
Now I can't leave
And now I'm actin' hella elite
Never want the niggas that's in my league
I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy

Cocaine and drinkin' with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend
I'm not fazed, only here to sin
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can

Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way
Call me when you want, call me when you need
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like

Oh, call me by your name (Mm, mm, mm)
Tell me you love me in private
Call me by your name (Mm, mm, mm)

Billboard bebeğim, Dua Lipa gelirken onları dans ettir
Herkes koşacak bir dans pisti arıyor

Eğer benimle kaçmak istiyorsan, bir galaksi biliyorum
Ve seni gezmeye götürebilirim
İçimde ritme kapılacağımıza dair bir his var
Müziğin ömür boyu durmadığı bir yerde
Parıltı gökyüzünde, parıltı gözlerimde
Tam istediğim gibi parlıyor
Eğer bir ortağa ihtiyacın olduğunu düşünüyorsan
Benimle mükemmel zamanda tanıştın

Sen beni istiyorsun, ben seni istiyorum, bebeğim
Şekerim, havaya uçuyorum
Samanyolu, kaçıyoruz
Evet, evet, evet, evet, evet

Yakladım seni, ay ışığı, sen benim yıldız ışığımsın
Bütün gece sana ihtiyacım var, hadi, benimle dans et

Bütün gece sana ihtiyacım var, hadi, benimle dans et
Havalara uçuyorum

Ben en iyilerindeyim, tartışılacak bir şey yok (Hadi)
Hala uçuyorum, ağır ilaç etkisindeyim
İronik, Ben onlara aşk veriyorum sonunda yine benden nefret ediyorlar (Git)
Kız bana söyledi beni seviyormuş ve beklemiş
Senin aşkın için çabalıyordum ve sabrım tükeniyor
Sarılacak birine ihtiyacım var, temele bile döndüm
Görüyor musun bana neler yaptırdığını (Evet)
Beni yerimden edebilirler, ama kimse bu eylemi durduramaz
Uh-uh, hadi
Sol ayak, sağ ayak, uçuyorum (Hadi)
Pop Yıldızları (Git), Dua Lipa ve DaBaby
Peşinde olduğum tüm nimetler için ayakkabılarımı bağlamak zorunda kaldım (Git)
Eğer düşersem, daha iyi bir durumda olurum
Yani yetiş, daha iyisin yap
Kalk ve parayı kovala (Evet, evet)
Hep terk ederler düştüğünde, ama beraber koşarsınız (Hey)
Dünyanın ağırlığı omuzlarımda, başımı dik tutuyorum
Şimdi, bebek, aya kalk, çünkü, kız, sen

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you wanna do?
It's written all over your face, times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
(On repeat)

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on mе, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me--------------------

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it--------------------

I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?

Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting like I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through (Yeah)

Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him 'cause I found him
Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you

Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?--------------------

(One, two, three, four)
Ooh, ooh

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lеad to you

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand

She keep playing me dumb, uh (Play me)

Y'all don't really know my mental
Let me give you the picture like stencil
Fallin' out in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pourin' down (Pourin' down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which, which way to turn
Flow was cool, but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (Ayy)

Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work (Yuh)
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (Uh, get it)
Everything that I do is electric (Ayy)
I'ma keep it in a motion, keep it movin' like kinetic, ayy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man, I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (Now let me pray), uh
I've been goin' right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)
Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimmin' in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh (Ayy)
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine (Spine)
They say that I'm so fine (Fine)
You could never match my grind (True)
Please do not, not waste my time (Wolf)

(D-D-Daytrip took it to ten, hey)
Bebe geri döndü, ayy, çifte değerli, ayy
Onun çifte Grammy'leri, çifte plaketleri, ayy
Bu bir gerçek, ayy, salla kalçayı, ayy
Salla kalçayı, ayy

Ve bu da şampiyonlar için
Başladığımdan beri kaybetmedim, evet
Bunun son olduğunu söylemeniz çok komik, evet
Sonra yine yaptım, evet

Sana uzun zaman önce yolda söylemiştim
Bekledikleri şeyi aldım
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmam, peşini bırakmam
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara gizlenmediğimi söyle
Zaten beni hiç desteklememiştin
Tekrar zirveye çıktığımda, senin şunu dediğini duymak istiyorum
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmıyor, kaçmıyor
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara molanın bittiğini söyle

Ah, yapmam gerekiyor, ah
Bu albümü bitirmem gerekiyor
Birkaç bir numaraya ihtiyacım var
Her şarkıda bir plakete ihtiyacım var
Şimdi Nicki'yle bir tanesine ihtiyacım var
Bir rap zencisine sizi görmediğimi söyle, hah
Ben Bieber gibi pop zencisiyim, hah
Ben sürtükleri becermem, ben ibneyim, hah
Ama bu zenciler Madea gibi kaltaklar, evet, evet, evet, ayy (Evet)
Oh, hadi yapalım
Düşmedim, sadece yeni şeylerimi piyasaya sunmadım
Ünlü oldum, şimdi herkes beni dava etmeye çalışıyor
Siz bana Nas diyorsunuz, ama mahallem bana Doobie diye sesleniyor, evet

Ve bu da şampiyonlar için
Başladığımdan beri kaybetmedim, evet
Bunun son olduğunu söylemeniz çok komik, evet
Sonra yine yaptım, evet

Sana uzun zaman önce yolda söylemiştim
Bekledikleri şeyi aldım (Bekledikleri şeyi aldım)
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmam, peşini bırakmam
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara gizlenmediğimi söyle (Sürtük, hiçbir yerden kaçmıyorum)
Zaten beni hiç desteklememiştin (Ooh, ooh)
Tekrar zirveye çıktığımda, senin şunu dediğini duymak istiyorum
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmıyor, kaçmıyor
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara molanın bittiğini söyle (Evet)

Sicilim o kadar temiz ki, beni ezip geçmek için sabırsızlanıyorlar
Fazla hızlı parlamış olmalıyım, dünyanın beni gazlamasına izin vermemeliydiniz (Woo)
Artık çok geç çünkü burada kalıcıyım ve bu kızlar benim edepsiz olduğumu biliyor (Mmm)
Onu erkek arkadaşına, kıçındaki el izimle geri gönderdim
Tüm şehir konuşuyorken, notlar alıyoruz
Söyle onlara, paylaşıma devam etsinler
Keşke öldürebilse, ama yaklaşamaz bile yanıma
Üstadım o kadar gurur duyuyor ki benle, kadehini kaldırırken boğazı düğümleniyor
Ben senin kontrol edemeyeceğin türden biriyim, yapacağımı söyledim, sonra da yaptım
Söylentileri aydınlatmam (Ayy), espri anlayışınız nerede? (Ayy)
Şaka yapmaktan bıktım çünkü bebek boomer'lar gibi yaşlandılar
Haterlarımı tüketicilere çevirdim, eskilere kendilerini küçük enişte gibi hissettiriyorum (Küçük)
Zamanının yaklaştığını söyle, ama tıpkı Oklahoma gibi (Mmm)
Benim zamanım daha erken geliyor (Mmm), ben sadece geç büyüdüm (Mmm)
Lisede zirve yapmadım, hala buradayım ve daha da şirinleşiyorum (Woo)
Tüm bu sosyal ağlar ve bilgisayarlar
Bu amcıklar ezik değillermiş gibi etrafta dolaşıyor

Sana uzun zaman önce yolda söylemiştim
Bekledikleri şeyi aldım (Bekledikleri şeyi aldım)
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmam, peşini bırakmam
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara gizlenmediğimi söyle (Sürtük, hiçbir yerden kaçmıyorum)
Zaten beni hiç desteklememiştin (Ooh, ooh)
Tekrar zirveye çıktığımda, senin şunu dediğini duymak istiyorum
Hiçbir şeyden kaçmıyor, kaçmıyor
Askerlerini kap gel ve onlara molanın bittiğini söyle (Evet)

See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't

Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah

Oh-oh, I know You won't (I know You won't)
I know You won't (Oh), oh (Oh, yeah)
I know You won't, I know that You look over us (I know)
So we silently sleep
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh

Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was up for sale, but I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, "What do you love?"
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, it was all so simple

I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know You're watchin' me
Eighty degrees, burnin' up the leaves
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water
Won't you shine Your light? Demons talk on my shoulder
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't--------------------

Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes (In your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Would you?

Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (In control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age

How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Would you?

You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad

Up, up, up (Ayy), up (Uh), up, look (This is fire)
Once upon a time, man, I heard that I was ugly
Came from a bitch who nigga wanna fuck on me

I said my face bomb, ass tight
Racks stack up Shaq height
Jewelry on me, flashlight
I been lit since last night
Hit him with that good good
Make a nigga act right
Broke boys don't deserve no pussy
(I know that's right)

Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back and all these bitches fucked
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga, man
Birkin bag, Bardi back and all you bitches fucked
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Ayy)
Up, then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck (Huh)
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Woo)

I could make the party hot, I could make your body rock
Bitches say they fuckin' with me, chances are they probably not
If I had a dick, you'd probably lick it like a lollipop
Hoes speakin' cap-enese, hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever poppin' shit, pullin' up and droppin' shit
Gotta argue with him 'cause a nigga love a toxic bitch
Niggas out here playin', gotta make 'em understand
If ain't no ring on my finger, you ain't goin' on my 'Gram

I said my face bomb, ass tight (Yeah)
Racks stack up Shaq height (Yeah)
Jewelry on me, flashlight (Huh)
I been lit since last night (Woo)

Make a nigga act right (Ah)
Broke boys don't deserve no pussy

Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back and all these bitches fucked (Woo)
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga, man
Birkin bag, Bardi back and all you bitches fucked

If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Ayy)
Up, then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Ayy)

Bitches ain't fuckin' with me now and I can see why
Dirty-ass, dusty-ass bitch, you got pink eye
Bitches want smoke until I bring it to they doorstep
Tell that bitch back back, breath smell like horse sex (Ha)
Put it on him now, he will never be the same (He won't)
Tatted on my ass 'cause I really like the pain (Ah)
He nutted on my butt, I said, "I'm glad that you came"
If that nigga had a twin, I would let 'em run a train (Skrrt)

Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back and all these bitches fucked (Woo)
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga, man
Birkin bag, Bardi back and all you bitches fucked (Ooh)

If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh (Woo)
Up, then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck (Woo)
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh

Look, gotta play it safe, huh

Tú no me dejas en paz, de mi mente no te vas

Pensar en ti, bebé, pero cuando bebo
Me viene tu nombre, tu cara, tu risa y tu pelo, ey
Dime dónde tú está', que yo por ti cojo un vuelo
Y a Yonaguni le llego, oh

Vi que viste mi story y subiste una pa' mí
Yo que me iba a dormir, ey

Si me da' tu cuenta de banco, un millón de peso'
To'a la noche arrodillado a Dio' le rezo
Pa' que ante' que se acabe el año tú me de' un beso
Y empezar el 2023 bien cabrón
Contigo y un blunt
Tú te ve' asesina con ese mahón (¡Wuh!)
Me matas sin un pistolón
Y yo te compro un Banshee
Gucci, Givenchy
Un poodle, un frenchie
El pasto, lo' munchie'
Te canto un mariachi
Me convierto en Itachi, eh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Brown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

And ain't it funny? All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

(Ah-ah-ah)
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
(Ah-ah-ah)
When she's sleepin' in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
You gave me your word, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still, you're still a traitor

Yeah, you're still a traitor

A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

Do you love me, or love me not?
Peeling piecеs from my heart
And my rose-colored lеns is gone
Still I carry, I carry, I carry on

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
