I'm still a fan even though I was salty
Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy
Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one should

I might
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one will

I might (I)
I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

I did it all for love (Love)
I did it all on no drugs (Drugs)
I did all of this sober
I did it all for us, oh
I did it all for love (Love)
I did all of this on no drugs (Drugs)
I did all of this sober
Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'm gon' kill your ass tonight)

Oh, I just killed my ex (My ex, oops), not the best idea (Idea)
Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here? (He left me no choice)
I just killed my ex (My ex), I still love him though (I do)

Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath till you get down on one knee
Because you only want to hold me when I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me? Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair, well, it's only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
(Ah)
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night

Surrounded by couples all the time

Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (Hold me)
Now I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (Say what you say, but I want it more)
But still, I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now I'm left here feelin' stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

I look for his arrows every day
I guess he got lost or flew away
Waiting around is a waste (Waste)
Been counting the days since November
Is loving as good as they say?

I gave a second chance to Cupid (Hopeless girl is seeking someone)
But now I'm left here feelin' stupid (Who will share this feeling)
Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real (I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb (A fool for love, a fool for love)--------------------

Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, oh

Vives en mi estado de sueño
Trasladas mi fantasía
Me mantengo en la realidad
Vives en mi estado de sueño
A cada instante cuento ovejas
Esa es la única vez que nos besamos, besamos
Existes detrás de mis parpados, mis parpados
Ahora no quiero despertar

Visión, visión, visión, visión perfecta
Cupido me dio, Cupido me dio con presición, yo
Me pregunto si miras a ambos lados
Cuando mi cruzas mi mente, dije, dije
Estoy harto, harto, harto, harto de perseguirte
Tú eres la persona que siempre está corriendo a través de mis sueños, yo
Yo solo puedo ver tu cara cuando cierro mis ojos

¿Puedo tener un beso?
¿Y puedes hacer que dure para siempre?
Dije que estoy a punto de ir a la guerra
Y no sé si volveré a verte
¿Puedo tener un beso? (¿Puedo?)
¿Y puedes hacer que dure para siempre? (¿Puedes?)
Dije que estoy a punto de ir a la guerra (A punto)
Y no sé si volveré a verte
(Ah, enciéndelo)

Dije, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, mi infatuación
Se está trasladando hacia otra forma de ¿cómo lo llamas? (Amor)
Oh sí, oh sí, oh sí, no te conocí
Estuve buscando, frena la espera antes de que frene la persecución, como un alcohólico
No me entiendes, ¿qué carajos quieres decir?
Son esas mejillas teñidas de rosa, sí, son esos ojos color tierra
Té helado con azúcar y miel, abejorro en la escena
Sí, renunciaría a un pastel para obtener un pedazo de tu pie
¡Yeugh!

Visión, visión, visión, visión perfecta
Cupido me dio, Cupido me dio con presición, yo
Me pregunto si miras a ambos lados
Cuando mi cruzas mi mente, dije, dije
Estoy harto, harto, harto, harto de perseguirte
Tú eres la persona que siempre está corriendo a través de mis sueños, yo
Yo solo puedo ver tu cara cuando cierro mis ojos (Entonces)

¿Puedo tener un beso? (¿Puedo tener un beso?)
¿Y puedes hacer que dure para siempre? (Que dure para siempre)
Dije que estoy a punto de ir a la guerra (A punto de ir a la guerra)
Y no sé si volveré a verte (Volveré a verte)
¿Puedo tener un beso? (¿Puedo?)
¿Y puedes hacer que dure para siempre? (¿Puedes?)
Dije que estoy a punto de ir a la guerra (A punto)
Y no sé si volveré a verte

Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la-la, la-la
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh

Beni sarıp sarmalıyorsun bana hayat veriyorsun

Uh, iki ayağıyla zıplıyor
Güneş doğana kadar, uykumuzu almıyoruz
Haftanın yedi günü, yedi farklı çarşaf
Yedi farklı pozisyonda, fantezin olabilirim

Gel bakalım bebeğim senin gururunu yutacağım

Ulaş bana ve kayayım sana

Everybody in the suite kickin' up they feet
Stand up, bitch, dance

Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh

Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense (Nonsense)
Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in (When you walk in)

Oh, it feels so good

You're talking shit for the hell of it

You're terrified to look down

Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here

Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter

Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me

I lied too, way before, before (How they feelin', how they feelin' right here, ooh)
Before I had you right inside my arms (Feelin' like some money tonight)
But then again, I could be drunk (Yeah)

I know, mami, I know (Know), it's 2 a.m., don't stress (Stress)
At three, that bullshit kick in, in thirty, you'll feel your best
I turned my whole spot to crucial, it's crucial, the way I left (It's lit)
Upstairs is like a low, my new bitches be the best (Let's go)
I'm lookin' at her, when her startin' to turn into you (Her)
Now you startin' to fuck up my mind, is it you, is it her?
We brought Booby Trap to the 'burbs
F29 is my address, in case you ain't heard
It's floodin' upstairs, it's a leak
I don't make it squeak, make it squirt
I make this shit beat, bon appétit when I feast
Slippin' and slide through the streets
It takes a finesse, especially in this Cabriolet Jeep
Engine make it hard to creep
Just leave the gate open, through the side door, I'ma creep (Ooh, ooh)
Are you by the Turrell? And are the kids downstairs asleep?
And are you upstairs by yourself? A minute from there
Is there some room for me? Baby, do tell, do tell

Tell me, is you still up? (Up)
It's 5 a.m. and I'm drunk right now
Tell me, can we still fuck? (Fuck that shit)
One of one, I'm in the zone right now
Tell me, am I still? (Mm)
Tellin' you just how I feel right now
You said it's just the drugs and I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lied too, way before (Let's go), before
Before I had you right inside my arms
But then again, I could be drunk--------------------

Last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' 'bout life, goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

I know that last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your mama, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, "Let her go"
Your friends say, "What the hell?"
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else

Oh, baby, last night, we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said, but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said, but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night (Last night)
No way it was our last night (Last night)

I know you said this time you really weren't comin' back again

Mate, what do you think of that girl?
The one dancing alone, I like her for myself
Beautiful, she knows she's hot
Everyone's watching her dance
I approach her and lay on the charm
We drink without reservations, just temptation
I told her, "I'm going to win over your family, and in a few days you'll be mine"
She said I'm crazy, but she likes that
No guy acts like me

Here you go, sweetheart
And all double P, man
Just like that, my buddy Pedro
All Eslabon Armado
For the young ladies
Cha-chau!

I'm not a guy with money
But when it comes to the heart, I fulfill everything for you
I held her hand tightly
My friend couldn't believe it, as I passed by
Her body, I swear to God, was so perfect
Her waist like a model's
Her eyes captivated me from the start
She liked me, and I like her--------------------

Go buy a zip of weed, hit the club
Pay for 'bout ten niggas to get in
We crunk, lit, in this bitch, yeah
Know we walk around the world
Steppin', not givin a damn 'bout where our feet land at, yeah
Get your ass mushed, smooshed (6ix)
Yeah, 21, the biggest
Put a nigga in the chicken wing, pussy

21, can you do somethin' for me? (21)
Can you hit a lil' rich flex for me? (21)
And 21, can you do somethin' for me? (21, 21)
Drop some bars to my pussy ex for me
Then 21 (21), can you do somethin' for me?
Can you talk to the opps necks for me? (21)
21, do your thing 21, do your thing (21)
Do your thing, 21

Yellow diamonds in the watch, this shit cost a lot
Never send a bitch your dot, that's how you get shot
I DM in Vanish Mode, I do that shit a lot
Took her pantiеs off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exеs ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it
I know you on your period baby, can you suck it?
I'm a savage (21)
Smack her booty in Magic
I'll slap a pussy nigga with a ratchet (Pussy)
I might slap a tracker on his whip and get the addy (Pussy)
Don't call me on Christmas Eve, bitch, call your daddy (21)
Bitch, call your uncle (21), bitch, don't call me (21)
Always in my ear, your hoe a flea (Fuck)
Why my opps be posting guns and only use they feet? (21)
Paid like an athlete, I got—

All you hoes, all of you hoes need to remember who y'all talkin' to
It's a Slaughter Gang CEO
I got dick for you if I'm not workin', girl
If I'm busy then fuck no
You need to find you someone else to call
When your bank account get low, you need to find you someone—


Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm on that Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit
Ayy, Slaughter Gang shit, ayy, murder gang shit, ayy

Sticks and stones, chrome on chrome
That's just what a nigga on
Internet clones, got 'em kissin' through the phone
Pussies cliquin' up so they don't feel alone, ayy
Man nigga seein' me, I'm Young Money CMB
I used to roll with CMG, the house is not a BNB
The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND
I'm steady pushin' P, you niggas pushing PTSD
I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing BNE
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then its BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late
21 my addy, so my knife is on the gate
All my dawgs eatin' off a Baccarat plate
Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayy

8 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishРусский (Russian)PortuguêsDeutschDave & Central Cee - Sprinter (Türkçe Çeviri) Lyrics
Agalarım çok düşüncesiz, 5 yıldızlı otellerde sigara içiyorlar
Finnegan ile kodein karıştırıyorlar
Hatun fitleşti, ama yine zayıflamak istiyor
Elma sirkesi içiyor
Skim giyiyor, çünkü Kim ve onlar gibi olmak istiyor
Uh, tamam, sinsi olduğunu biliyorum, masum davranmayı bırak
Bu para babadan oğla geçmiyor, bu milyonları 1 senede kazandım
Arabam Tokyo Drift'te olabilirdi çünkü aynı hızlı ve öfkeli
Toyota Yaris’ten Urus'a geçtim, onların da şansı vardı ama mahvettiler
Şimdi bu hatun beni rahminin içinde istiyor, neyse, zenginim, hadi yapalım (Neyse)

Şu elmaslara yanlış bak, hayat göz kısıncaya kadar geçer, dik dik bakamazsın
Hatunla iyi günde kötü günde, onun götü çok iyi, yolu yarıladım (hahaha)
Kahverengi ve seksi, fikrimi değiştiremezdim, yolu yarılamıştım
Yüz metre, huh, az önce Sprinter'a dokuz tane hatun attım (Uh)
Yüz tane yutucu, bir SUV’a sığamazlar (Yok)
SOS, birileri beni kurtarsın
Peşimde çok kız var, çok, çok kız var, Peşimde
İki haftada hevesimi alırım (Uh,huh)
Tamam, hadi adresini yolla artık, lütfen

SUV, dışı beyaz, içi kahverengi resmen Michael Jack
Torba tutmaya biraz daha sıra gelsin, paraları sevmiyormuş gibi harcıyorum
Tabancayı Irish Ferry botunda çıkardım, çek tetiği de tap dansı gibi ses çıksın (Bap)
Öyle takılırım ki, sarım yok, hakem bana siyah kart çıkartmak zorunda kaldı
Bizim rap ile yaptığımızı kim yaptı?
Yıllardır müziklerinde sattığı yalanlardan sonra konserinin biletleri bile tükenmedi
Sprinter, van araca iki kız sığmaz
Inter, Milan'da iki adam
Benim kızlardan birinin Diddy ile çıktığını duydum
Kopardığının yüzde 20'si benim olur
Dışardayım, ellerim başımın üzerinde

Onlara dedim ki adım Cench, hatun dedi "Yok, kimlikteki adın ne?"
Erkek arkadaşın elmas hakikilik testinden kaçtı, çünkü sahtelerdi (Yok be)
Hatun Kıbrıs Türkü, ama kalça Brezilyalı, uh
Onu istiyorum, agam da ortak girmek istiyor
Bu konuda ucuzum, hala kızlara gidip "Selam, Netflix'ini ödünç alabilir miyim" diyorum
Hatun feminist, beni cinsiyetçi sandı
Kelimelerimi çarpıtıyor, galiba disleksik
Bana biraz zaman tanı, uzay boşluğundayım
Sana Insta şifremi vermeden önce, AmEx kartımın şifresini veririm
Huh, tamam
Paslanmaz çelik değil, o platinyum
Yemek masası, görgülüyüm, tişört içimde, peçete
"Still Loading", başlık bu, sadece az bir kesir tuttum
İyi ye, metabolizmam iyi
Mahallemde kar beyazı, Aspen yok
Acılarımdan Aspirinle kurtulamıyorum
Dave Aston'a atladı geldi, şu Maybach müziğini yapıyorum (M-M-Maybach Music)
Zekamı aşağılamaya çalışıyorsun, bazen aptalca davranabilirim
Asla üniversiteye gitmedim, ama kampüste öğrencilere kokain satmışlığım var
Eğer agam drum beatini salarsa, sonra müzikler sızarsa, kişiye özel iş yapmayız

Şu elmaslara yanlış bak, hayat göz kısıncaya kadar geçer, dik dik bakamazsın
Hatunla iyi günde kötü günde, onun götü çok iyi, yolu yarıladım (hahaha)

Kadını döveni ateşe atarım, bunlara boyun eğemem
Kızı terapiye göndermek zorunda kaldım, sütyeni E beden, yükü çok
Jamaica, Oracabesse'deyim
Girer girmez döviz bürosuna gittim
Öyle çalışmaz, piyon o, satranç değil
Az konuşup çok iş yapıyorum
Fukara karılarla takılmaya bayılıyorum, bir uçak biletime üzerime düşüyorlar
G63’teyim, arabam bariyer ve engebelere karşı bana arkadaş gibi sarılıyor
Kalçalar için yaşayanlar ve ölenler var
Rezillik, hangisi daha kötü bilmiyorum bile
Hapı yuttum, kızda ve adamda çantalar, onun neyi varsa onundur, benim neyim varsa da
Kız para için benleymiş, senle çıktıysa doğru olamaz
Bebek mavisi AP, kağıtlar pembe, ben olsam ben de benden nefret ederim
Hiç 6 haneli sayılar harcayıp kıza dönüp "Bak bana ne yaptırdın" diyebildin mi?
Yeah, tamam, sıra ile başladım, sırada durmadım
Garip, benim siyahi asyalı hatunuma "Neden hep Asyalı tarafına odaklanıyorsun" diye soruyorum
Köşebaşındaki bebelerin cluba girip Dave’in locasında oturabilmek için dua ettiklerini biliyorum--------------------

Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother

Got no alibi

My radiant beam in the night

You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh)

We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did

For the love of my life?
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life

My radiant beam in the night (Ah)
I don't need no light to see you

Hey

Haven't heard from you in a couple of months
But I'm out right now and I'm all fucked up
And you're callin' my phone, you're all alone
And I'm sensing some undertone
And I'm right here with all my friends
But you're sending me your new address
And I know we're done, I know we're through
But, God, when I look at you

My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)
Like blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)
Should probably not
I should probably, probably not
I should probably, probably not

Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
Fuck it, it's fine

Yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect?
I only see him as a friend
The biggest lie I ever said
Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect?
I only see him as a friend
I just tripped and fell into his bed

Now I'm gettin' in the car, wreckin' all my plans
I know I should stop, but I can't
And I told my friends I was asleep
But I never said where or in whose sheets
And I pull up to your place on the second floor
And you're standing, smiling at the door
And I'm sure I've seen much hotter men
But I really can't remember when

My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)
Like blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)
Should probably not
I should probably, probably not
I should probably, probably not

Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
Fuck it, it's fine

Yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect?
I only see him as a friend
The biggest lie I ever said
Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect?
I only see him as a friend
I just tripped and fell into his bed

Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
Can't two people reconnect?
The biggest lie I ever said

The girl that said a void can be filled with somebody else is lying to you
It's like covering a wound with makeup, you don't see it, but you still feel it
You left, saying you were over me (Ayy) and you got a new girlfriend
What she doesn't know is you (Auh) still watch all of my stories (No, papi)

Baby, what happened? Weren't you doing well? (—ell)
Why are you looking for me? You know I don't make any mistakes twice (Ayy, papi)
Tell your new baby, that I don't compete for men
That she should stop hating, 'cause at least I kept you looking cute

Seeing you with the new one hurt (Hurt)
But I'm already ready for my own thing
I forgot everything that we lived
And that's what got you so offended
Even my life got better
You're no longer welcome here
I saw what your girlfriend said about me
I'm not even upset, I laugh, I laugh

I don't have time for whomever can't contribute, I changed directions
Making money as if it was a sport (Ah)
Filling up my account, concerts, the parking, and my passport (Ayy)
And reports are saying I look hotter (Yes)
Now you wanna come back, I can tell, mmm, yeah
Keep waiting for me, 'cause I'm an idiot (Ah)
You forgot I'm doing my thing
And that La Bichota was too good for you

Baby, what happened? (Happened) Weren't you doing well? (Ah)
Why are you looking for me? (Ayy) You know I don't make any mistakes twice (Ayy, papi)
Tell your new baby that I don't compete for men
That she should stop hating, 'cause at least I kept you looking cute (Shakira, Shakira)

You left and I got triple M
More hot, more toned, more chill
Go back to you, never, you were bad luck
Because now blessings rain down on me
And you want to come back, I saw it coming
Liking my photo
You were looking for food on the outside
And I used to say it was the monotony
And now you want to come back, I saw it coming
Liking my photo (Mine)
You look happy with your new life, but
If only she knew you still look for me

Baby, what happened? (Happened), weren't you doing great? (Ah)
Why are you looking for me? (Ayy) You know I don't make any mistakes twice
Tell your new baby that I don't compete for men (Shake that ass)
That she doesn't have a good hand, and at least I kept you looking cute

O-O-Ovy On The Drums
My love, you got too far away
And I can't see from afar, baby
I love you, but I was too good for you, hahaha

Edepsizlik yapıyorum ve sataşıyorum, onun üstünde oturuyorum
Tüm elmaslarım onun üstüne ışıldıyor
Onunla barda buluştum, saat on iki veya öyle bir şeydi
İki şarap daha istedim çünkü bu gece onu istiyorum

Eğer umurunda olacaksa sana olaydan biraz bahsedeyim
Kendimi berbat bir durumun içinde buluyorum
Sevdiğim adam geçen gece beni karşısına oturttu
Ve bana her şeyin bittiğini söyledi, aptalca bir karar
Ve ben kalbimin nasıl parçalandığını hissetmek istemiyorum
Aslında, hissetmek istemiyorum, bu yüzden içmeye devam ediyorum
Ve ben bugün basit bir görevle şehirdeyim
Küçük siyah elbisemin içinde, üstüme de baya bir oturuyor

Sadece kalbi kırık bir kaltak, topuklu ayakkabı 15 santimetre
Gece kulübünün arkasında, şampanya yudumluyorum
Takıldığım bu kaltaklara güvenmiyorum
Taksinin arkasında kokain çekiyorum
Sarhoş aramalar, sarhoş mesajlar, sarhoş yaşlar, sarhoş seks
Benimle aynı kafada bir adam arıyordum
Şimdi başa dönüş, bara dönüş
Bentley'e, otele, eski alışkanlıklarıma

Çünkü geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Doktor, doktor, herhangi bir şey, lütfen
Doktor, doktor, bana acı
Bu acıyı al
Belirtilerimi soruyorsun, doktor, hissetmek istemiyorum

Bu esrarı içiyorum, stresimi böyle atıyorum
2019 gibi eski alışkanlıklarıma döndüm
Eski sevgilimin bitirmesinin üstünden 24 saat bile geçmedi
Üstümde yeni bir adam, biraz terlemek üzereyiz
Geçen gece çok mükâfatlıydı
Kötü günler geçirdim ve bu baya bir canımı yakıyor
Beni mazur gör, benim yatağıma girme umutların
Ne kadar yüksekse benim de kafam o kadar iyi
Bardağı yarı dolu görmek için geri adım atarsam
En azından bu iki parça Prada içinde dolaşıyorum
Ve ben çoktan pislik gibi davranıyorum, ne dediğimi anlıyor musun?
Boş boş duracağına içime sok

Sadece kalbi kırık bir kaltak, topuklu ayakkabı 15 santimetre
Gece kulübünün arkasında, şampanya yudumluyorum
Takıldığım bu kaltaklara güvenmiyorum
Taksinin arkasında kokain çekiyorum
Sarhoş aramalar, sarhoş mesajlar, sarhoş yaşlar, sarhoş seks
Benimle aynı kafada bir adam arıyordum
Şimdi başa dönüş, bara dönüş
Bentley'e, otele, eski alışkanlıklarıma

Çünkü geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Doktor, doktor, herhangi bir şey, lütfen
Doktor, doktor, bana acı
Bu acıyı al
Belirtilerimi soruyorsun, doktor, hissetmek istemiyorum (Ne?)

Çünkü geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Değiştiremeyeceğin şeylerle barışık ol (Geçen gece)
Ayrılırken çıplak olacağım ve geldiğimde de çıplaktım, evet
Erişilemez, ulaşılamaz
Çok uyuşmuş, hiçbir şekilde hissetmiyorum
Kadeh kaldır, ne olmuş yani?
Sokak küçük, ama her iki yöne de gidiyor
Yani, koşacaksın, evet
Ama asla kaçamayacaksın
Labirentte gün batımı
(Belirtilerimi soruyorsun, doktor, hissetmek istemiyorum)

Geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum, oh
Doktor, doktor, herhangi bir şey, lütfen
Doktor, doktor, bana acı
Belirtilerimi soruyorsun, doktor, hissetmek istemiyorum

Geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum
Geçen geceki gibi hissetmek istemiyorum

Mm, rujum modern sanat gibi dağıldı
Nerede olduğumu ya da lanet olası arabayı kimin kullandığını bilmiyorum
Otoyolda hızlanıyor, yudumluyorum
Hapları likörle karıştırıyorum, bu duyguları sikeyim
Sevdiğim herkesi görüldüde bıraktım (Uh-huh)
Yatağımdaki yabancıya sırlarımı döküyorum (Uh-huh)
Hiçbir şey hatırlamıyorum bu yüzden pişman olacak bir şey yok (Uh-uh)

安物のウイスキーが俺の心を癒してくれる

助手席ではラブラドールがくつろいでいる
君の髪についた砂が俺の目に入ってきて
ビーチのせいにしてくれ　大の男は泣かない
あの壊れた地下室のソファを覚えてるかい？
俺がラブソングを歌っていると君は
君の母さんがどうして指輪を質に入れて出て行ったかを教えてくれるんだ
すべて、すべて覚えているよ

閉店時間の冷え切った態度
君は俺に日が昇るまで一緒に居てほしいと懇願したのに
おかしな言葉が口から零れる
大人の男の心が壊れたときは
写真と過ぎ去った時間
君は飲んでるときだけそんな風に笑うんだ
したくないけど、そうしてしまうよ
君と過ごした夜の、一瞬一秒を思い出す

あなたは心を癒すためなら何でも飲む
でも私の心はいつになったら癒してくれるの？
あなたといると、まるで夏の暑さに熱せられたコンクリートの上を歩いてるようで
二人の魂が出会うとき、それは地獄のように燃え上がる
あなたはあなたがいつも誓っていたような男にはなれないわ
でも、あの88年型フォードで歌うあなたのことを忘れない

Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)

Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

Let loose, crazy, then get soaked
Get wet from my body, you know, in the Benz, get in
What's up? My baby in the Mercedes-Benz
The stars on the ceiling, stellar has already left
But you know that this night you're for me
Come, climb on top of me, send me your location, I'll pick you up

She wants me to play music for her
So the baby dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yestеrday
She wants me to play music for her
So thе babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

She has not yet forgotten how we spent time
We went to the club and the two of us danced close together
Like dogs close together, kisses and a couple drinks
She stayed by my side and said, "I think I fell in love"
She smokes, she drinks
She's a little devil, small, but spicy
I love it when she rubs it against my pants
She loves it, you can see it in her face, she enjoys it

She's got a boyfriend and doesn't behave
She tells me, "Chill, 'cause the relationship is broken"
Our bodies crash and crash
Our mouths get together, the leggings choke her

She wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday
She wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

Yesterday, yesterday you were moving very well, very well
She got covered in the smell of Chanel
We're a thousand degrees Fahrenheit
She's hot and has a pretty face
You play music for her, and she gets horny by herself
For the party, she never holds back
A couple friends, she completes the crew
But you, mama, you know, I like you a lot
Crazy, come here, get close all the way back
You and me will go on a fleeting journey
Interstellar, eat you out
We will both smoke marijuana
In my room, on my rooftop and on my bed
Bae, I think you're getting a call, answer tomorrow
Don't let the fire die
On the AMG, listening to "Ruedas y Cristal"
Burning poison that got me flying, mami
A little kiss to the Barbie, so she dances close
Slanty eyes like Puki from Taiwan, -an
Like Puki from Taiwan
Like Puki from Taiwan
I eat that pussy whenever I want, mami, mami

Let loose, crazy, then get soaked (Baby, all the way down)
Get wet from my body, you know, in the Benz, get in (Baby, all the way down)
What's up? My baby in the Mercedes-Benz (Baby, all the way down)
The stars on the ceiling, stellar one has already left (Eh)

Oh, she wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday
She wants me to play music for her
So the babe dances all the way down
We drank a couple bottles
And still, she remembers that we did it yesterday

Today is the night to be single
She likes twerking and dancing close to you
The young religion
The double P
Lil Yng
It's the remix--------------------

Voy a tomar, nena
Vemo'

Silbo, uh (Uh)
Quita esa mierda de aquí (Aquí)
Te llenaste luego de un sorbo (Sorbo)
Cayendo, pero tengo agarre (Agarre)
Todo alrededor de la trampa, lo acierto (Acierto, acierto, sí)
Todo alrededor detrás, tú viajas (Skrrt)
Tómalo como nueve de diez (Sí)
Mi chica va a encontrar eso de nuevo
Mi chica va a comprar eso de nuevo
Detrás de la carpa, dije que me desahogo
No me olvido dе tal lugar al que fuimos
Justo después de ponеr eso en mi cabeza
¿Todavía sigues tomando? ¿Tú bailas?
¿Todavía lo sigues botando? Sé que puedes
Tengo mucho, pero todavía estoy arriesgando

Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
Hace tiempo no te veo, eh
Es que ahora en Miami jangueo, eh, eh
Ya no tengo la Rodeo
Ahora en la G-Wagon me spoteo, ey
Y te lo meto al frente 'e la playa
Como aquello' tiempo' de camino a Maya
Tú ni fumaba' y chingando te arrebaté
Dale, no pierdas tiempo, no lo piense', trépate
Tú bien loca, loca, yo bien loco, loco
Si ahora tu mai nos pilla, me pide una foto
La nota me explota, el ticke' lo exploto
Vamo' pa' Cayo Musha, ya le texteé al piloto, eh-eh

Yo sé que fue una vez
Te sientes como tal ganadora (Ganadora)
Esa noche estaba tan buena
Necesito que regreses más pronto (Más pronto)
Vuelves de este lado
Cuando ella vuelva más genial (Genial)
Lo manejamos una vez más
Estoy agarrando tu uno (Uno)

Ooh (Uno)
Ooh-ooh (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Ooh (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Ooh-sí (Mm-mm)

Mezclo las drogas con el dolor
Dejo que las olas guíen el camino
Tú en Cannes y Saint Tropez gritando mi nombre
Nieve alrededor de mi cara, sí
Sabes que ando drogado del K-Pop
Frotándome en tu cuerpo
Toda tu ropa, te la vas a sacar
Sur de Francia, vamonos de fiesta
Esto no es un pequeño yate
Vamos a follar hasta que nos mareemos
Eres mi pequeña mala mami, mami
Tú me amas, puedes decirme que me amas
Incluso si no lo dices en serio (Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm)
El sexo te hará creerlo
Me encanta cuando ella se pone sobre mí (Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm)
Amo cuando ella me llama "Papi"
A pesar de que ella es coreana (Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm)
La tengo mojada, ese tsunami, 'nami, ooh, sí (Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yo sé que fue una vez
Te sientes como tal ganadora (Ganadora)
Esa noche estaba tan buena
Necesito que regreses más pronto (Más pronto)
Vuelves de este lado
Cuando ella vuelva más genial (Genial)
Lo manejamos una vez más
Estoy agarrando tu uno

Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah (Uno)--------------------
